The average work week also declined by 0.2 hours, largely offsetting the effect of a penny increase in hourly wages (to $3.34) on weekly earnings.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.2 percent, to 1044.38, as all 10 of its industry groups declined. 

The Associated Press average of 60 stocks declined S2.20 to $173.50. This erased the gains made in last week's surprising pre-holiday advance.

GM's sales declined by an even steeper 49 percent, and Chrysler's fell 55 percent from January 2008, according to Ward's Automotive Group, which tracks the industry.

The stock market declined today, but there was very little pressure behind the move.

NEW YORK -- Indecision marked the dollar's tone, as traders paused for breath, awaiting a critical monthly U.S. employment report for release today.</br></br>The dollar ended the New York day slightly weaker against both the euro and the yen.</br></br>Market participants were also reluctant to make major bets on the yen, following a stream of more rigorous-sounding statements from top Japanese officials about the issue of bank reforms.</br></br>Late yesterday afternoon in New York, the euro was at 98.77 cents, slightly stronger than its 98.68-cent level late Wednesday.

Prices for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production in November dropped for the second straight month

WASHINGTON -- In a sign that inflation remains under control even as the economy regains momentum, prices at the wholesale level dropped 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said.</br></br>The fall in the producer price index was caused by a big 1.5% drop in energy costs, reflecting the recent weakness in crude oil prices, and a 0.5% decline in food prices. Excluding these volatile sectors, producer prices edged up 0.1% in November after dropping 0.1% the month before. For the year ended in November, wholesale prices rose 1.3%.</br></br>Analysts said the latest inflation report indicates wholesalers are refusing to raise prices even as demand for their goods is picking up.</br></br>"Wholesalers and retailers are competing on a price containment basis," said Samuel Kahan, chief economist of Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. "Instead, they are making profits through productivity gains."</br></br>Prices were subdued across the board last month. Consumer goods and capital equipment showed moderation in pricing. There was a 1% rise in the price of passenger cars last month, following a drop of 2.3% in October. Prices for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production in November dropped for the second straight month. Excluding food and energy, prices of intermediate goods were unchanged in November while prices of crude goods declined 0.9%.

U.S. wholesale prices sank further last month, a sign of how quickly the inflationary pressures of last summer have reversed. U.S. producer prices in December were down 0.9% from the previous year, the biggest yearly drop since 2001.</br></br>Energy prices fell 9.3% last month from November, as wholesale gasoline prices tumbled 25.7%. Food prices declined 1.5

WASHINGTON -- With lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.</br></br>As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.

WASHINGTON -- Overall consumer prices didn't increase at all in January, according to the Labor Department, some thing that hasn't happened in more than four years. Clothing, trans portation and energy prices declined as well, while housing prices moderated.

NEW YORK -- Many options traders were reluctant to take advantage of puts and calls whose prices have been discounted ahead of the Labor Day weekend. A broad barometer of options prices, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, declined 0.31 to 19.28, a level that is widely regarded as indicating that prices are cheap.

GOLDEN, Colo. -- Atlas Air Inc., which provides freight flights for airlines, is expected to announce an agreement today to fly three Boeing 747 jumbo jet cargo planes for Federal Express Corp.</br></br>The outsourcing deal, valued at more than $30 million in annual revenue for Atlas, is believed to be part of FedEx's strategy to restructure operations to reduce reliance on its own pilots. Federal Express, a unit of FDX Corp., Memphis, Tenn., declined to comment.

WASHINGTON -- The interest rate-sensitive housing sector showed mediocre gains in housing starts last month and is expected to weaken in the coming months as interest rates rise, economists said. In June, this sector saw an increase of 8.5%. In May, the rate declined 8.1%.

The former head trader at a hedge-fund giant settled regulatory allegations that he systematically attempted to manipulate prices of platinum and palladium, a sign that commodities regulators are intensifying efforts to crack down on manipulation in the futures markets.</br></br>Christopher Pia--former head trader at hedge fund Moore Capital and a major player at the fund for 18 years--agreed to pay $1 million to settle civil allegations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator said in a release Monday. The CFTC alleged that he tried to artificially move futures prices near the very end of daily trading in a maneuver called "banging the close," which involves inundating the market with trading orders. The $1 million penalty is one of the largest ever levied by the CFTC against an individual.</br></br>The settlement comes amid a boom in which the prices of metals and other commodities have skyrocketed, raising concerns at the CFTC about possible manipulation and abusive practices. One way investors bet on commodities is through the futures market, where they enter into contracts to buy or sell raw materials at a set price on a specified date. The CFTC now has a broader mandate and new tools to attack violations in the commodities markets.</br></br>Under the CFTC settlement, the 45-year-old Mr. Pia, once one of the most powerful traders on Wall Street, also agreed to a permanent ban in trading CFTC-regulated products in platinum and palladium, such as futures contracts. He also is banned from trading instruments regulated by the CFTC during the closing period, the final few minutes of trading when settlement prices are determined. Mr. Pia hasn't traded in the contracts involved in the settlement since May 2008, according to a person close to the situation.</br></br>A lawyer for Mr. Pia declined to comment.

NEW YORK -- A disappointing report on the labor market and continued concern about a possible overextension during the market's third-quarter surge pushed stocks into the red for the seventh time in eight sessions Friday, led by industrials such as General Electric, Boeing and Caterpillar.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.61, or 0.2%, to 9487.67. For the week, the index slipped or 1.8%, marking its second weekly decline in a row, though it remains up 8.1% for the year to date.</br></br>"The entire third quarter was one big run. To me, this is just a healthy working off of an overbought condition," said Gary Flam, a portfolio manager with Bel Air Investment Advisors. "Still, putting money to work right now is akin to picking up nickels on the train tracks. You may get a couple dollars in your pocket, but you run a significant risk of getting run over."</br></br>For Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500 lost 4.64, or 0.5%, to 1025.21, including a 1.5% drop for industrials. For the week, the S&P 500 declined 19.17, or 1.8%, losing 4% in the past two weeks.</br></br>Among the slate of industrials, GE fell 61 cents, or 3.8%, to $15.36; Boeing lost 71 cents, or 1.4%, to 51.40; and Caterpillar fell 62 cents, or 1.3%, to 48.83.

VENTURE INVESTING in small firms continues on a downward spiral.Venture-capital funding for small companies plunged 66% in the first quarter, industry researchers report.</br></br>Investments declined to $185 million from $539 million a year earlier, says Venture Economics Publishing Co., an industry research concern in Needham, Mass. The number of companies getting funds slid to 173 from 333. 

THE FED IS POISED to ease interest rates modestly in response to growing evidence of a credit crunch, Greenspan said. The Fed chief also said the agency is working to boost capital rules for banks and to toughen their enforcement.</br></br>Stocks and bonds rallied on Greenspan's statement on interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 37.13 points to close at 2969.80, a record. The dollar declined.

Sales of existing homes fell sharply in October as rising interest rates continued to take a toll on consumers. Nevertheless, sales remain brisk by historical standards and are on track to set a record this year.</br></br>In October, sales declined 6.6%, according to the National Association of Realtors, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units. That was down from September's 5.13 million rate and was 3% below the 4.94 million level set in October 1998

For the year to date, the Dow Jones Stoxx index of 600 leading European companies is up 19.3%. That compares with a measly 0.2% advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 3.1% increase in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.</br></br>Behind the performance disparity is a Fed that in the past 17 months has steadily raised rates to 4% from 1%.

Washington -- Contrary to popular belief, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is capable of speaking clearly. A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing.</br></br>"A striking feature" of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, "has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business."</br></br>Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve "pricing power" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare "service" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000

The old dragon of inflation -- thought to have been slain -- may be lurking.</br></br>Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.</br></br>It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.</br></br>Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.</br></br>But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it. "Industry sectors are trying to recoup what they gave up in the depth of the downturn," said Mark Steinkrauss, vice president of investor relations for Fruit of the Loom Inc. The company raised prices 5% on a line of T-shirts at the start of the year.

VENTURE INVESTING in small firms continues on a downward spiral.</br></br>Venture-capital funding for small companies plunged 66% in the first quarter, industry researchers report.</br></br>Investments declined to $185 million from $539 million a year earlier, says Venture Economics Publishing Co., an industry research concern in Needham, Mass. The number of companies getting funds slid to 173 from 333. With the decline continuing in the second quarter, venture capital for small companies could sink below $1 billion for 1991, less than half 1990's $2.1 billion, Venture Economics says.</br></br>"The downward trend in venture investing has intensified," says David Schutt, editor in chief of Venture Economics. He says big institutions, disappointed by recent returns, are scaling back their involvement in venture funds. Only 15 venture-capital funds raised money from investors in the first half of this year -- a combined $541 million, off 43% from $954 million a year earlier.</br></br>Analysts say the recession has also slowed the flow of money, as venture capitalists negotiate bargain prices for stakes in struggling concerns.

AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>Friday's report that April unemployment jumped to 5.8% from 5.5% was viewed by some investors as a sign that the Fed may have raised interest rates so high that the economy could stall later this year. That would put heavy pressure on corporate earnings, the driver of the bull market rally that has seen stock prices post a series of new highs recently.</br></br>Most economists, however, say they believe it's premature for investors to start worrying that a recession is near and say that investors may be overreacting to recent economic indicators.</br></br>"There's no question that in the last couple of days more and more people have begun considering that maybe the soft-landing is going to be a hard landing," says Ed Nicoski, chief market strategist at Piper Jaffray. "Two days of market action doesn't offer enough evidence for a meaningful conclusion, but the thinking has certainly shifted."</br></br>After a relentless six-month rally in which major averages gained nearly 20%, stock prices have stumbled in the past two sessions. The declines have been relatively modest, but they come in stark contrast to a powerful bond market rally during the same two sessions. Long-term interest rates have now dropped to 7.025% as bond bulls cheer the steep slowdown reflected in recent economic data.

Sales of existing homes fell sharply in October as rising interest rates continued to take a toll on consumers. Nevertheless, sales remain brisk by historical standards and are on track to set a record this year.</br></br>In October, sales declined 6.6%, according to the National Association of Realtors, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units. That was down from September's 5.13 million rate and was 3% below the 4.94 million level set in October 1998.</br></br>"An increase in mortgage rates is translating into a slowdown in home sales -- exactly what the Fed wanted" when it raised interest rates three times this year, said Kory Bockman, an economist with the NAR in Washington.</br></br>Still, home sales are likely to top 5.20 million units this year, besting last year's 4.97 million mark and the fourth consecutive record year.</br></br>"It's still a good time to be a Realtor," said Mr. Bockman.

TAIWAN'S ECONOMY has shifted into high gear, with stronger-than-expected growth.</br></br>Economists have raised their 1986 economic-output estimates because of a recovery in exports, low oil prices and falling interest rates. The government's Council for Economic Planning and Development originally set a 5.5% target for growth this year in Taiwan's inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's output of goods and services. Now, however, officials say they expect GNP to increase at least 7%. In 1985, GNP grew 4.7%.</br></br>"The general economic tone is good," says Mark Mobius, president of the International Investment Trust Co., which manages stock-market funds in Taiwan. "I wouldn't be surprised to see 8% growth this year."</br></br>Exports, the driving force in Taiwan's economy, have bounced back, totaling $5.39 billion in the first two months of 1986, up 11.3% from a year earlier. The strengthening of the U.S. economy helped boost exports to that nation 15% during the period, to $2.85 billion. A drop in the value of Taiwan's currency, which makes Taiwanese products more price competitive abroad, also is a factor.</br></br>One cloud on the horizon for business is the introduction in Taiwan next Tuesday of a value-added tax of 5% on all transactions. Economists and government officials say this could cause a mild acceleration in inflation.

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the economy has left its soft spot behind and that companies' pricing power is more evident, suggesting more interest-rate increases are to come.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan also focused on new risks to the economic outlook, specifically high housing prices. In a report released yesterday, the Fed said the value of all U.S. housing climbed 15% in the first quarter from a year earlier, and mortgage debt rose 13%, both easily outstripping the 6% gain in after-tax income over the same period.</br></br>"The soft readings on the economy observed in the early spring" did not presage "a more-serious slowdown," Mr. Greenspan told Congress's Joint Economic Committee. Though there have been periods of weakness during the expansion, they are "backing and filling. . . . Instead of the economy going very smoothly forward it goes in little cycles. And hence, it's often misread as though we're about to tilt into a recession."</br></br>He said inflation was "contained," but cited risks: slowing productivity growth, which makes it more costly for firms to boost sales, and "evidence of increased pricing power."</br></br>The Fed has raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3% in eight quarter-point steps from 1% last June. Mr. Greenspan didn't address future rate moves, but quoted from the Fed's May 3 statement that interest rates would likely continue to rise at a "measured" pace. That has come to mean a quarter point per meeting. His commentary suggested that the Fed, contrary to recent speculation, probably will raise rates at least a few more times.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE pushed up short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point, sending a clear inflation-fighting message. The increase is likely to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses: Many big banks raised their prime lending rates after the Fed announcement. The rise also is likely to bolster the dollar against foreign currencies.</br></br>The credit tightening sparked a rally in bond prices, pulling stocks higher. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond soared nearly 1 3/4 points as its yield fell to 7.36%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 24.28 to 3784.57.</br></br>---</br></br>American Home Products and American Cyanamid renewed takeover talks yesterday, even as American Home's unusual one-day offer expired. People familiar with the talks said the two companies were discussing a friendly combination, with a deal possible as early as today.</br></br>---

A TEST OF HEDGE-FUND resilience is playing out in Japan.</br></br>A fund run by U.S.-based Whitney & Co., one of the biggest in the Japanese market, has lost nearly a quarter of its value so far this year, people familiar with the fund say.</br></br>These people say Whitney New Japan Fund, which had assets of $1.3 billion at the end of 2005, has reported to investors declines of about 23% through July. Another fund, Whitney Japan Select Fund, with assets of about $200 million at the end of 2005, has dropped about 29% in the period, the people say.</br></br>Whitney declined to comment.</br></br>Whitney's predicament reflects the pain many hedge funds are experiencing amid global market volatility. The pain has been acute in Asian markets, where hedge funds in the region last year raised billions in fresh capital from investors. Whitney's struggles mirror those of dozens of Tokyo-based hedge funds.

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. postponed for six months an increase in the premium banks and thrifts pay for deposit insurance and said that it will design a system that requires weak banks to pay higher premiums than strong banks. Each one-cent increase in the premium costs the nation's 12,500 banks about $250 million annually. The FDIC last raised premiums July 1, 1991, by 3.5 cents.
A so-so first-quarter earnings season hasn't dented investors' enthusiasm for stocks.</br></br>Profit at large U.S. companies modestly exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations, while revenue was weak and many companies ratcheted down growth projections.</br></br>But stock prices have been rising, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 16% for the year and 4.2% since earnings season began April 8 with a mixed report from aluminum company Alcoa Inc.</br></br>The developments have added up to a rise in stock-market valuations. The price/earnings ratio on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now stands at 14.5, its highest level since 2010.</br></br>Stock-rally skeptics said that spells trouble. They contend soft U.S. economic growth and expanding P/E multiples can't coexist forever. Economists predict U.S. gross domestic product will expand at a slower rate in the second quarter than the first, when it increased at a 2.5% annual rate. Government spending cuts known as the sequester came into effect March 1. The Labor Department said Thursday that initial jobless claims increased by 32,000 to a seasonally adjusted 360,000 in the week ended May 11, the largest one-week gain since November.

NEW YORK -- Bond prices fell as the surge of corporate-bond issuance continued, led by the largest U.S. corporate global-bond offering to date. The bond sales siphoned interest from Treasurys and raised fears among some investors that savvy corporations are selling bonds ahead of rising interest rates.</br></br>The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32, or $3.75 for a bond with $1,000 face value, to 102 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 5.95%.</br></br>A much-awaited bond deal went off without a hitch. Ford Motor Credit Co. sold a $3.25 billion two-part global offering, the largest such deal to date. In all, about $5.4 billion of corporate bonds were sold.</br></br>The Ford deal, underwritten by joint lead managers Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Bear, Stearns & Co., was increased to $3.25 billion from $2.5 billion because of strong investor demand.</br></br>"There was overwhelming demand globally, with a fairly higher component of European interest than we've seen in the past, and smaller interest from Asia," said Paul Young, a senior syndicate official at Salomon Smith Barney. "The deal validates the large-global-benchmark concept, that investors like these large benchmarks."

NEW YORK -- Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks rose solidly, although both groups saw intraday gains pared sharply by the end of the actively traded session.</br></br>The Nasdaq and small-cap markets were driven higher by a rally in technology stocks following release of Ciena's fiscal first-quarter results. The fiber-optic networking-systems company posted earnings that beat analysts' projections, and raised its 2001 revenue-growth forecast. Ciena surged 16% to $89 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.</br></br>Ciena's outlook contrasts starkly with many recent quarterly earnings reports, which have been characterized by warnings that revenue growth is expected to slow for the first half.</br></br>The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 61.51, or 2.47%, to 2552.91, after posting an intraday gain of 101.69, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks, at 508.85, gained 5.36, or 1.06%, having been up as much as 6.53.</br></br>Rare Medium Group surged 56 cents, or 24%, to 2.88. The New York Internet-consulting and venture-capital company reported a fourth-quarter loss that was the same as its year-earlier loss, with revenue rising 66%. Analysts said the stock was bolstered by takeover speculation after the company's chief executive reportedly said the company was being approached "with strategic options that we are evaluating very seriously."

NEW YORK --- Corporations rushed a record amount of new notes and bonds to the market yesterday to take advantage of the lowest long-term interest rates in two decades.</br></br>Companies ranging from steelmaker Weirton Steel Corp. and telecommunications company Pacific Bell, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, to wood products, gypsum and chemicals concern Georgia-Pacific Corp. issued $5.81 billion of new debt, a one-day record, according to Securities Data Co. The previous record was set Jan. 8, 1992, when $5.25 billion of debt was offered. So far this week, companies have borrowed $12.97 billion, just under the one-week record of $13.3 billion raised in the week ended Jan. 11, 1992.</br></br>The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond remained unchanged yesterday at 6.88% as its price dropped very slightly to 102 29/32. Before last week, the bond yield had never dipped below 7.10% since the Treasury began regular 30-year bond auctions in 1977. The price of 10-year notes dropped 1/8 point to 101 17/32 to yield 6.03%, up from 6.01% on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year note has hovered at 20-year lows for the past four trading sessions.</br></br>While interest in the corporate notes and bonds seemed strong, said underwriters, demand was not nearly as strong as in January, when corporations issued more than $37 billion of new notes and bonds.</br></br>Some underwriters worried that yesterday's flood of new issuance could quell the strong investor demand for new corporate bonds in evidence so far this year.

The rapid rise in interest rates since late March is turning off some people who have invested in stocks. They are selling shares and hoarding cash, with a few already hunting for bargains in the bond market.</br></br>The move away from stocks accelerated Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 52.97 to 2272.52. It was the fourth-largest point decline in the history of the industrial average.</br></br>"There were a lot of reasons not to buy stocks," said Peter Furniss, a managing director with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York. Traders said they saw few buyers for stocks Friday. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,378 stocks lost ground while just 291 advanced.</br></br>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 6.81 to 287.43 and the Big Board's composite index dropped 3.51 to 162.25.</br></br>For stock investors, a litany of negative news Friday fanned fears of surging inflation and much higher interest rates. Producer prices jumped an unexpectedly sharp 0.7% in April and major banks raised their prime lending rates to 8 1/4% from 8%. It was the third increase in the prime rate in seven weeks, with the previous one just two weeks earlier.
Officials Press</br></br>Japan on Rates</br></br>International Monetary Fund officials said Japan's central bank should keep the pace of interest-rate increases "gradual," and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged it not to raise rates until the end of 2008 to ensure an end to deflation. The OECD predicted Japan's real gross domestic product would rise 2.4% this year, higher than the 2% growth it had forecast. In 2008, the OECD said, the economy would expand by 2.1%.</br></br>Smoking Banned</br></br>In 75% of Homes.

Aluminum Co. of America said yesterday that its second-quarter profits rose 31 percent over last year, despite a month-long strike by 15,000 union members.</br></br>Also yesterday, RJR Nabisco Inc. said its net rose 21 percent in the quarter; Bell & Howell Co. said it suffered a 21 percent dip in second-quarter earnings, and Sperry Corp., in its final earnings report, said its profits fell 87 percent in its first fiscal quarter, mainly because of special costs related to its acquisition by fellow computer maker Burroughs Corp.</br></br>Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh, said net income for the three months was $53.3 million (63 cents a share).

"NEW YORK, Feb, 24 (UPI) Overdue profit taking, fueled by recession news, drove the stock market to its worst loss in more than two months today in moderately active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, a 15-point winner last week, fell 12.83 to 736.94, its worst loss since it dropped 15.64 on Dec. 2.

Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in August and prices at the wholesale level jumped 0.3 percent, but neither report was enough to support Wall Street‰Ûªs fears of a return to raging inflation or an economy heating up, economists said yesterday.</br></br>Many analysts said there is little evidence to suggest that the economy will continue on anything but a sluggish track, including the latest government statistics released yesterday. Many traders who fueled the record 86-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday were relying on a report last week showing that civilian unemployment in August declined from 6.9 to 6.8 percent, economists said.</br></br>However, economists said that a small drop in unemployment for one month does not make a trend and that other statistics suggest continued stagnation.</br></br>The Labor Department yesterday reported that the increase in the producer price index followed a 0.4 percent decline in July and no change in June.</br></br>In a separate report, the Commerce Department reported that the retail sales increase was the largest since a 0.9 percent rise in April. However, the increase in August was all attributed to brisk auto sales. Sales were up 0.3 percent in July.

Sales of new homes tumbled 5.8 percent in April while a key index of future economic activity slipped 0.1 percent, two signs that the Federal Reserve's higher interest rates are beginning to slow the economy. The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes edged down to an annual rate of 909,000 last month in the biggest one-month drop since a 7.2 percent decrease in September. Meanwhile, the index of leading economic indicators declined by 0.1 percent last month, according to the Conference Board in New York.</br></br>Virginia's jobless rate dropped to 2.3 percent in April, only the third time the rate has been that low in more than 30 years, the Virginia Employment Commission said. The rate dropped from 2.5 percent in March and was far below the national jobless rate of 3.7 percent in April. The number of Virginians looking for work declined from 91,500 in March to 82,000 in April. Fairfax City had the lowest jobless rate at 0.6 percent, followed by the city of Bedford at 0.7 percent. Manassas Park and Greene, Rockingham and Loudoun counties had rates of 0.9 percent.</br></br>AT&T, which is trying to become the largest U.S. cable-TV provider through acquisitions, plans to carry the Hot Network, a pay-per-view channel that shows sexually explicit movies.

NEW YORK, Feb. 3 (AP)The stock market declined irregularly and against stubborn resistance today in a hectic session which had all the earmarks of a temporary climax to the market's six-day advance.</br></br>Volume of 5.21 million shares compared with 4.9 million yesterday and was the heaviest sipce the yearend session of Dec. 30.</br></br>Large blocks were traded.

This week, President Clinton proposed spending more than $1.5 trillion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 - an amount equal to 21.6 percent of what the administration forecasts the nation's gross domestic product will be.</br></br>That would be the smallest the government would be in relation to the economy since 1979. It hit a post-World War II record of 24.4 percent in 1983 and has since declined to 22.3 percent.</br></br>However, the chart at the right shows another way to measure the government's demands on the economy: How much it spends for goods and services that it itself consumes and invests.</br></br>By this measure, the size of government in the current fiscal year will be about 6.7 percent of GDP, the smallest share since 1948. Under the proposed budget, it is slated to fall to 6.4 percent next year.

Unemployment among District of Columbia residents continued to decline in October, reaching a seasonally adjusted rate of 6:4 percent, William R. Ford, director of the D.C. Labor Department, reported yesterday.</br></br>The rate was a sharp decline from October 1978, when 7.9 percent of the city‰Ûªs work force lacked jobs.

Barneys New York Inc., the swanky retailer known as a magnet for fashionistas, is headed for talks with lenders to get a handle on a debt load that stems from its 2007 takeover by Dubai investors.</br></br>In the past couple of weeks, Barneys has tapped bankruptcy and restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis, said people familiar with the matter, as the chain aims to rework its finances and keep a nascent turnaround on track.</br></br>Barneys, a niche company dwarfed by competitors Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Saks Inc., needs to refinance a $200 million credit line that comes due in September. To do so, Barneys may need to reduce other debt mostly held by hedge-fund manager Richard Perry and supermarket magnate Ron Burkle.</br></br>The debt load is mostly the result of a private-equity takeover of the company five years ago that burdened it with an additional $500 million in debt.</br></br>Istithmar World, the investment arm of state-owned Dubai World, paid $942.3 million for Barneys in a buyout at the top of the market in 2007. Istithmar in early 2010 invested $20 million to boost Barneys' coffers as it struggled in the wake of the recession.

Two years ago, Yelp rejected a bid from Google for about $500 million, people familiar with the matter said.</br></br>Yelp received an investment of $25 million in January 2010 from Elevation Partners, a private-equity firm, people familiar with the matter said. Elevation also spent $75 million acquiring additional Yelp stock from both employees and earlier investors. That investment valued the company at about $500 million, the people said. The funds from Elevation gave Yelp the time to decide when to pursue an IPO, one of the people said. Elevation has also invested $270 million in Facebook Inc. at an average valuation of $16 billion.</br></br>The reviews site makes money in much the same way as rival Google, by selling ads to local businesses that appear near search results and also by selling premium ads to big brand advertisers. But compared with some other popular ad-based Internet services, Yelp has been slow to capitalize on its popularity with users, in part because its business model requires a large sales force. Facebook, in contrast, was also founded in 2004, but in the first half of this year had revenue of $1.6 billion, mostly from ads, according to people familiar with the matter.
TOKYO -- Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s agreement to purchase an 18% voting stake in PaineWebber Group Inc. marks an effort by the big Japanese insurance company to tap the high end of the financial business. The Yasuda official said that "global asset management" is very high on the list of things PaineWebber can teach. Yasuda is the fifth-largest Japanese life insurer, with $22 billion in assets. Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co  invested about 17% of assets in bonds, stocks, real estate and loans to non-Japanese.</br></br>PaineWebber hopes, for its part, that the association with Yasuda will help the U.S. firm's presence in Tokyo.

New Japanese investment in the U.S. will slow from last year's record pace but will remain significant, analysts say. Japanese investors also are expected to accelerate the diversification of their U.S. holdings away from bonds and into equities and real estate.</br></br>The major factors behind the expected shifts are the weak U.S. dollar and relatively low U.S. interest rates.</br></br>Private Japanese investors purchased an equivalent of about $115 billion of foreign assets, in the U.S. or in Eurodollar bonds in 1987 

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group plans a major revamp of its manufacturing process that it hopes will shave billions of dollars off the cost of developing and producing cars over many years. The long-term challenge for Detroit's car makers remains ending the cycles of overproduction and binge-discounting that have characterized the U.S. market since 2001, and better matching production to shifting consumer demand. In recent years, DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group in Detroit has invested too heavily in vehicles that consumers didn't end up wanting in huge numbers.

NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it introduced a stock-market index for medium-sized companies smaller than most of those contained in the S&P 500 stock index.An estimated $250 billion is recently invested by Standard & Poor's Corp in index funds designed to mimic the performance of a basket of stocks, most often the S&P 500. But the very popularity of S&P 500 indexing has led some investors to pay greater attention to other segments of the stock market, including medium-sized stocks, and more recently, small stocks.

PENNSYLVANIA -- Private-equity firms Berkshire Partners LLC and Weston Presidio acquired Amscan Holdings Inc, a party-goods maker for about $540 million according to people familiar with the matter. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. private-equity vehicle took the company Amscan, Elmsford, N.Y in 1997, paying $290 million for its then-publicly traded stock. Since then, GS Capital Partners II LP has invested $77 million in the balloon-making business, in part to purchase other balloon-making companies.

CHICAGO -- Plenty of Americans know that Japanese investors have gobbled up Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and New York's Rockefeller Center. It was only three years ago that Japanese securities firms began buying seats on Chicago's Board of Trade and Mercantile Exchange, the two biggest U.S. futures markets. Certainly, Japanese investors have invested heavily in U.S. Treasury bonds and related futures, but not much in U.S. equities or the corresponding futures.

Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa is becoming a serious player in the international battle to attract companies from abroad to set up cost-effective customer call centers on its shores. Last week, U.K. short-term insurance broker Budget Insurance said it has invested around 100 million rand ($14.7 million) in a 200-seat call center in Cape Town with plans to treble its size.</br></br>U.S.-based investment manager State Street Corp., meanwhile, unveiled a plan to develop a back-office operation in Cape Town for its custodial services.

Fiat Industrial has lost faith in the Italian stock market, if not--yet--in Italy itself. Fiat Industrial would find it costly to move from Italy, where it has nearly a quarter of its plants and employees; in the last five years it has invested [euro]3 billion in Italy.

American investors may be shunning U.S. stock funds these days, but not the Japanese; a record $700 million of Japanese money this week was invested in a new U.S. mutual fund.</br></br>The new fund, Nomura Rosenberg Alpha Fund Mark II, is managed by Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management of Orinda, Calif invested $700 million from Monday through Wednesday, with orders scattered among 35 brokers in stock-index futures and individual stocks.</br></br>The Japanese fundholders aren't outright bullish about the U.S., though. Although the fund will be fully invested in U.S. equities, its dollar currency exposure can be hedged by Nomura against the yen. Perhaps influenced by the dollar's more than 50% plunge against the yen over the past three years, the fund is starting out with 60% of its holdings protected against a drop in the dollar.</br></br>Japanese insurance companies and trust banks have invested plenty of money in U.S. equities in the past few years. 

Federal regulators have launched a major review of the nation's top banks to ensure compliance with rules barring firms from linking the price or availability of loans to a corporate client's use of the bank to underwrite its stock or bond offerings.</br></br>Companies covered by the review include Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank One Corp. and Wachovia Corp. Each owns a commercial bank that makes traditional business loans and an investment bank that provides securities services such as selling stocks and bonds to the public.</br></br>The government's interest in the tying of loans to securities underwriting stems from fears among regulators and legislators that bankers are being pressured to weaken their lending standards to win other, more profitable business from commercial clients. Regulators worry that weaker loans could imperil the overall health of the banking industry, whose deposits are insured by an industry-funded reserve run and backed by the federal government.</br></br>The review coincides with broader scrutiny of financial conglomerates and their tying of services, such as issuing favorable analyst reports to help win stock and bond business.</br></br>The review by banking regulators was detailed in a Aug. 3 letter, made public yesterday, from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr. -- the nation's two top banking regulators -- to Rep. John D. Dingell (D- Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Author: Dennis K. Berman</br></br>NEW YORK--The head of Government of Singapore Investment Corp., one of the world's most active sovereign-wealth funds, said Americans are being too hard on themselves and have failed to recognize the resilience of the U.S. economy.</br></br>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, GIC Executive Director Tony Tan Keng Yam said negative sentiment is a "problem when I talk to Americans. They don't see the potential in their own economy, which is one of the most innovative, open economies in the world. Foreigners seem more optimistic."Government of Singapore Investment Corp has invested more than $100 billion of government reserves into a portfolio of stocks, commodities, bonds and private-equity stakes. 

Bank of America Corp., facing community-activist opposition to its $46 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., said it will lend and invest $750 billion over 10 years in communities for programs such as affordable housing. After what was then NationsBank Corp. agreed to acquire BankAmerica Corp. in 1998, the combined Bank of America pledged to invest $350 billion over 10 years. The bank said yesterday it has completed the fifth year of that pledge. Since 1999, the bank said it has loaned and invested $230 billion in economic-development initiatives. FleetBoston is in the last year of its own five-year, $14.6 billion commitment that ultimately exceeded that amount by about $4 billion. The new pledge replaces both of those commitments, but activists want more from the bank.

THE ENTIRE real-estate world is on fire with investors right now, but one of the hottest corners is private REITs.</br></br>The private REITs invest in all types of commercial properties from office buildings to apartments to malls. Their shares don't trade on any exchange, and they shouldn't be confused with the much larger public real-estate investment trusts.</br></br>Private REITs, which are being heavily marketed, are sold almost exclusively through financial planners and advisers. Unlike public REITs, they have a fixed price of $10 a share. After a set period of time -- usually seven to 14 years -- private REITs are either taken public or liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to investors. In the meantime, investors usually receive a hefty annual dividend of approximately 7% to 8% -- higher than most public REITs pay currently.</br></br>About $7 billion was invested in private REITs in 2003, compared with the $4 billion invested in 2002. That, in turn, was double the $2 billion invested in 2001, according to the Investment Program Association, a trade group based in Washington, D.C.</br></br>One big downside with private REITs: Investors pay hefty initial fees of between 5% and 16%. Much of this goes toward paying commissions to planners who peddle the REITs. That means as little as 84 cents out of a dollar invested go for the actual real estate.

Since hitting a low in February, the stock market has roared higher in almost-uninterrupted fashion. The Standard & Poor's 500 has racked up a good year's gain -- nearly 13% -- in just two months' time, and now, near 1200, sits at levels not seen since September 2008. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has turned back its clock to June of that same year -- three months before Lehman Brothers collapsed.</br></br>Yet many small investors are still watching the rally from the sidelines. Through mid-April, investors have put about $6 billion of new money into domestic stock funds so far this year, according to Lipper data. By contrast, the small investors has invested just over $101 billion in taxable and municipal bonds.

Last February, just before the Federal Reserve began jacking up interest rates, a U.S. Army welfare and recreation fund invested $15 million in what looked like a sure thing.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in the investment bank's bid to buy $3 billion in tax credits from government-owned mortgage giant Fannie Mae, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>The involvement of Mr. Buffett adds a twist to what was already a politically sensitive deal. The Treasury Department is considering blocking any potential sale on the grounds that it wouldn't benefit taxpayers; the money Fannie Mae would earn would be offset by the fall in the government's tax income.</br></br>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized by the government last year, and the Treasury Department has invested close to $100 billion in the housing-finance giants.

There are no sure things in the stock market. But one of the most reliable direction-finders is the so-called "January effect. The phrase describes a theory of market behavior that states: ‰ÛÏStocks that fall in December will rise again in January."</br></br>For the past four years, Bonnie Wachtel, vice president of Wachtel & Co. of Washington, has tested this seasonal trading strategy and found that it works. While it was tougher to make it work this year than last year, Wachtel said, the strategy worked well enough to bolster her belief in the January effect.</br></br>"Our strategy is intended to identify stocks that are likely to depressed at year-end from tax selling by investors, who-have substantial losses in those stocks,‰Û Wachtel ' said. "We purchase shares in December and sell them in January, hopefully at a quick profit, when the selling pressure abates."</br></br>During last December, Wachtel invested $24,625 in 10 depressed stocks.
The 61-year-old government attorney wants to have $1 million by the time he retires in a few years and the only way he figures he can get there on his $60,000 annual salary is to buy stocks. Lots of them. Sometimes even using borrowed money.</br></br>That strategy worked well for Frandsen until these past few weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks has fallen 9.8 percent in one month and, like millions of Americans who rode the equity boom up, Frandsen is facing what may become the first substantial decline in stock prices since 1990.</br></br>"If the whole market heads south, I'll be wiped out," Frandsen said flatly Friday after the Dow dropped nearly 150 points, erasing its gain for the year. But the Gaithersburg man is sitting tight, even though all of his $260,000-plus retirement portfolio is invested in stocks.

"NEW YORK, Jan. 28" -- Stock and bond prices soared today and shortterm interest rates fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in its best one-day performance in 10 months. Over the years, the city has invested about $80 million building and maintaining the Silverdome, a theater, an outdoor entertainment pavilion and other projects that have become a major burden in a time of recession and a diminished GM, the largest taxpayer.

This ought to be a glorious moment for the telecommunications industry. Many people are spending record amounts of money to use its networks to talk and e-mail and exchange gobs of information. The pace of technological innovation is positively breathtaking. Trillions of dollars have been invested by people around the world in the growth of telecommunications industry.


Hedge funds used to reek of exclusivity. They were run by the most cunning traders on Wall Street, who employed exotic trading techniques designed to make money regardless of whether markets rose, fell or stayed flat. Their clients included only the super- rich.</br></br>Hedge funds are now a $1 trillion industry. Millions of middle- class people invest in them through pension funds or mutual funds.</br></br>The Virginia Retirement System, for example, recently increased its investments in hedge funds to $1.6 billion, or close to 4 percent of its assets. The Baltimore City Fire & Police Employees' Retirement System put $80 million into hedge funds last year, while the City of Baltimore Employees' Retirement System invested about $55 million, or 5 percent of its assets in Hedge funds.

The Wall Street Journal invested their money in retirement plans or college funds hoping not necessarily to become Rockefeller rich but to earn a decent return.

The answer, so far, is the federal thrift savings plan. The 17.07 percent rate is the average annual return for the C-fund (stock index) since it became available to investors in 1988. During the same period, the average return for the F-fund (bond index) was 8.28 percent. The super-safe (no market ups and downs!) G-fund, invested in Treasury securities, had a return of 7.55 percent.

WHX, a New York-based steelmaker, renewed its campaign to acquire defense contractor Teledyne for about $1.67 billion. Teledyne spent most of 1995 rebuffing WHX's hostile bid. Orbital Sciences suffered a setback as Rockwell International withdrew from a joint venture to create a reusable rocket for small satellite launches. Fairfax-based Orbital's shares fell $1.25 on the news to close at $13.75, with 483,400 shares changing hands, more than double the daily average during the past three months. Rockwell, Orbital invested $50 million and National Aeronautics, Space Administration have invested $70 million the steel manufacturing venture.

Four regional banks from around the country yesterday became the first firms to repay emergency aid from the government, but the show of strength also underscored concerns about the health of a key element of the federal economic recovery program.</br></br>The Treasury Department has invested almost $200 billion in more than 500 banks to support new lending to consumers and businesses, but the growing clamor among recipients to repay the aid earlier than planned threatens to diminish the impact.</br></br>The largest bank to exit, Signature Bank of New York, which returned $120 million, said it was acting to avoid the effects of congressional restrictions on aid recipients, including limits on pay that could drive away its most productive employees. Chief executive Joseph J. DePaolo also said that the aid had become an undeserved scarlet letter because of public perception that the program was being used to save troubled banks, rather than buttressing healthy firms.</br></br>Other returns included $100 million from Old National Bancorp of Indiana, $90 million from IberiaBank of Louisiana and $28 million from California's Bank of Marin Bancorp.</br></br>The repayments are the latest challenge for the investment program, which was introduced in November with the stated goal of investing $250 billion in thousands of banks. The Treasury immediately put half the money in the largest banks but since has distributed less than 60 percent of the remaining funds.

Six months after Washington rescued Wall Street, exasperated banks insist they want to leave the lifeboat.</br></br>Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, said yesterday that he regrets accepting $25 billion in federal aid. He called the money "a scarlet letter," pledged quick repayment and renounced further borrowing from the government, saying, "We've learned our lesson about that."</br></br>But the company, which announced a $2.1 billion first-quarter profit yesterday, has not entirely had it with Washington. J.P. Morgan said it plans to continue using a separate federal aid program through which it has borrowed more than $40 billion.</br></br>Other large banks are attempting the same combination of breakup and embrace. Even as they clamor to exit the most prominent part of the bailout program by repaying government investments, firms continue to rely on other federal programs to raise even larger amounts of money.</br></br>The Treasury Department so far has invested slightly less than $200 billion in banks. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has helped companies, including J.P. Morgan, borrow more than $336 billion through the end of March, by guaranteeing to repay investors if the firms defaulted. And financial firms hold more than $1 trillion in emergency loans from the Federal Reserve.

With the stock market whipping investors along gut-wrenching swings of 200 points or more in a day, the steady-as-she-goes FDIC-insured certificate of deposit has lately become an attractive shelter.</br></br>For Lisa Bend, the time to act came when she kept seeing reports that the Federal Reserve may soon lower interest rates, which could cause CD rates to drop. Wanting to lock in a good rate, Bend, 43, recently put a portion of her retirement savings into nine- and 12-month CDs from Internet bank ING Direct. She got an annual percentage yield, or APY, of 5.25.</br></br>"I had it sitting there, and I didn't know what to do," said Bend, who lives near Philadelphia. "I was looking at the stock market going up and down and up and down the past month."</br></br>A safe investment, surely, in volatile times. But there is a price to be paid for a guaranteed return. If you tie up your money for six months to a year or two, you could miss out if stock prices suddenly take off again.</br></br>So CDs, while a stable refuge, work most effectively as one component of a portfolio. Over the long term, stocks provide the best opportunity for your assets to grow. Historically, the U.S. stock market has offered investors annual returns averaging a little more than 10 percent if dividends are re-invested.

Microsoft launched an unusually caustic public broadside yesterday against Google, accusing its archrival of running roughshod over copyrights as it creates an online service for searching books.</br></br>Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association of Publishers in New York, Thomas C. Rubin, Microsoft's associate general counsel, devoted much of his remarks to an attack on Google's practice of copying entire books into its database, often without the permission of copyright holders.</br></br>"It systematically violates copyright and deprives authors and publishers of an important avenue for monetizing their works," Rubin said, according to prepared remarks. "In doing so, it undermines critical incentives to create."</br></br>Microsoft's salvo came as the software giant faces mounting pressure from Google, which is increasingly extending its reach beyond the Web search that made it the darling of the technology industry.</br></br>Last month, Google began selling an online productivity suite, including e-mail, calendar and Web services, that competes with Microsoft's Office software. Google also continues to extend its substantial lead over Microsoft in Web searching, an area where Microsoft has struggled and that remains the main way users navigate the Internet.

My highest priority as Treasury secretary is the long-term strength and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Managing our economic relationship with China to ensure both nations benefit is vital to our nation's future prosperity. A market-based economy in China, with sustainable economic growth and full participation in rules-based international trade, is in our best interest -- and in the interest of the Chinese people.</br></br>Since 1980 China's share of the world economy has more than quadrupled. The United States and China now account for almost half of global economic growth. And bilateral trade between our two nations grew by a factor of five over the past decade. Beyond the numbers, the U.S.-China economic relationship epitomizes both the opportunities and challenges of globalization.</br></br>This week a delegation made up of U.S. Cabinet secretaries, agency directors and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, will participate in the first meeting of our new Strategic Economic Dialogue with China.</br></br>Presidents Bush and Hu Jintao launched the dialogue in September to focus on China's successful integration into the global economy and ensure that China continues on its market-based reform path.</br></br>My colleagues and I will meet with Chinese leaders in Beijing for discussions in three areas: maintaining sustainable growth without large trade imbalances; continuing to open markets to trade, competition and investment; and improving energy security and the environment.

Rates on 30-year mortgages dropped this week to their lowest level in more than four years, effects of a startling November unemployment report and a government plan to buoy the housing market.</br></br>Freddie Mac reported Thursday that average rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 5.47 percent from 5.53 percent last week.</br></br>The rate is slightly below this year's previous low of 5.48 percent, reached in January, and the lowest since March 25, 2004.</br></br>Mortgage rates started falling after the Federal Reserve launched a sweeping new effort in late November to aid the housing market by buying up to $600 billion of mortgage-related securities and other debt issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks.</br></br>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee about half of the $11.5 trillion in outstanding debt on U.S. home loans.

When President Nixon determined in early February 1973 that the U.S. dollar had to be devalued for the second time in 14 months, he sent his under secretary of Treasury, Paul A. Volcker, on a secret mission to Tokyo and Bonn to get the agreement of the nation‰Ûªs two most important trading partners.</br></br>Volcker, who had played a key role since 1969 in patching up a series of gold and dollar crises, tucked his 6 foot 7 frame and everpresent cigar into an Air Force plane and headed for Tokyo.</br></br>There, he left a hat with his name at the Ministry of Finance, but the thoughtful Japanese got it back to him in time. In Bonn, however, his gangling frame almost blew the cover when a German reporter spotted him.</br></br>But with the dollar deal in his pocket, he telephoned the details to Treasury Secretary George Shultz. Nixon announced it Feb. 12, 1973, and a new era of fluctuating exchange rates was formally launched.</br></br>But the hopes of Volcker and others then that the leading nations of the world could work themselves back to a greater sense of monetary stability haven‰Ûªt been fulfilled, primarily because of the upheaval caused by oil price increases and worldwide inflation.

Leading Democrats launched a series of stinging attacks on President Bush here today, challenging his handling of the economy, response to corporate accountability scandals and conduct of the war on terrorism while charging there is a "leadership deficit" in Washington that they are prepared to fill.

NEW YORK. April 25 (AP)‰ÛÓThe stock market soared to still higher record peaks this week, broke on profit taking, then launched a new upward swell as the week ended.</br></br>Thanks to a sharp recovery on Friday, the market managed to post a small gain on average for the week. The Friday advance followed two days of decline after the popular averages climbed to historic high's on Monday and Tuesday.</br></br>Electronics and other space-age issues spurted once again. Blue chips, which paced last week‰Ûªs mafch to record highs, were not so prominent.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks rose 40 cents to $227.90. The last record of $228.70 was set on Tuesday.</br></br>At week‰Ûªs end the Dow-Joncs industrial average stood at 627.39 compared with its record of 629.23, also reached on Tuesday.

American Express Co. has for more than a year been secretly financing a newsletter that criticizes the interest rates charged by competing bank credit cards.</br></br>Bank Credit Card Observer, a frequently quoted publication produced in Kendall Park, N.J., has received‰ÛÓand will continue to receive until yearend‰ÛÓa subsidy "likely to approach $500,000,‰Û according to the American Banker, a trade publication that broke the story yesterday.</br></br>American Express began financing the newsletter a few months before it launched its own lower-interest Optima credit card to compete with MasterCard and Visa. The newsletter‰ÛÓ like several similar publications‰ÛÓhas given editorial credit to Optima for helping to drive down credit card interest rates.</br></br>American Express and John C. Pollock, the newsletter's publisher, yesterday confirmed the arrangement but declined to discuss the exact amount involved.

IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.</br></br>But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.

Fueled by lower stock prices and renewed confidence in the economy, the corporate takeover market is heating up. Just three months after Black Monday, bids and counterbids are being announced daily.</br></br>But the players are changing from the takeover boom of recent years. Most of the efforts in the current wave have been mounted by corporations rather than by corporate raiders.</br></br>Already this year, several multibillion-dollar bids have been launched, and a number of smaller offers-primarily hostile-have been made.</br></br>Among the largest deals is Eastman Kodak Co.'s planned $5.1 billion acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc.-a merger that Sterling accepted Jan. 22 to ward off a takeover by the giant Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffman-LaRoche.</br></br>The Canadian real-estate development firm Campeau Corp., which in late 1986 took over the Allied Stores Corp. department-store chain, has made an unsolicited $4.2 billion offer to buy Federated Department Stores Inc., the parent of Bloomingdale's and I. Magnin.

Correction: An Oct. 6 A-section article about China's role in the global economy incorrectly described a Morgan Stanley report on Chinese consumer spending. The report did not say that Chinese consumer spending will exceed U.S. consumer spending by 2018. It said that between now and 2018, Chinese consumers are likely to add more to global consumption than U.S. consumers, and that by 2018, Chinese consumers will be spending 40 percent as much as U.S. consumers, up from 16 percent in 2008. (Published 10/9/2009)</br></br>Chen Zizheng wheeled his shopping cart down one of the aisles at the Carrefour store near his house and paused in front of the bottles of Remy Martin, Johnnie Walker and Hennessy, each selling for an amount about equal to the annual salary he earned when he was a young government employee.</br></br>But those days were about 30 years ago, around the time Deng Xiaoping launched China on a path of economic reform and opening up. Now China's thriving economy has made it possible for people like Chen, a 67-year-old semi-retired aerospace industry official, to plop down 1,168 yuan, or $170, for a bottle of liquor at a branch of a French "hypermarket" chain.</br></br>"It's not that expensive for ordinary Chinese people now," he said, adding that he planned to serve Johnnie Walker Green Label to guests he was expecting to share moon cakes with during last weekend's mid-autumn festival.</br></br>"As Chinese society has developed and opened up, people have a better appreciation of imported liquor," said Chen, who used to buy the traditional Chinese stiff drink known as maotai. "When you choose a gift, other people will look at it and if it is brand stuff they will feel respected because you chose it for them."

LONDON -- Recent declines in interest rates encouraged two borrowers to launch Eurodollar bonds, but their offerings failed to find much support as many investors continued to avoid the market.</br></br>New Zealand launched two $100 million offerings with maturities of four and seven years. The issues were launched at costs of 45 and 55 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury yields, respectively. Those margins were roughly in line with issues outstanding, but didn't greatly appeal to investors. A basis point is 1/100 of a percent.</br></br>New Zealand's $100 million of 7 3/4% bonds due June 18, 1990 were priced at 100 1/8 to yield 7.71%. Another $100 million of 8% bonds due June 18, 1993 were priced at 99 1/4 to yield 8.145%.</br></br>The two issues will refinance debt, and New Zealand is expected to keep the proceeds in dollars. "They like the rates the way they are," said an official at lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.</br></br>"Nothing's moving quickly," one syndicate manager said. "There's just no buying interest around." Many investors remain uncertain about the direction of the dollar and U.S. interest rates, and so are avoiding fresh commitments, he said. The backlog of unsold issues also continues to hobble the market.

HANOI--Vietnam's leaders are stepping up their campaign against critical blogs, ordering government investigators to arrest the operators of three websites at a time when global Internet companies are growing more worried about doing business in the tightly policed country.</br></br>A government statement issued late Wednesday named three blogs that allegedly posted articles accusing the government of corruption and human-rights abuses, describing the blogs as being part of a "wicked plot of the hostile forces"--a term often used to describe advocates of democratic reforms.</br></br>Two of the three sites vowed to continue. One, Danlambao, or "The People's Journalism Blog," said in a fresh posting Thursday that its anonymous operators are "prepared to be repressed and imprisoned rather than leading the life of a dumb dog that dares not to bark," paving the way for a deepening confrontation between Vietnam's authoritarian leaders and its increasingly vibrant online community as the country's once-booming economy slumps.</br></br>The Web has taken off here faster than in many other up-and-coming nations. Around 34% of Vietnam's 90 million people are online, a larger proportion than in more established neighbors such as Thailand and Indonesia, driven in part by the rapid spread of high-speed cellphone networks and a desire among younger Vietnamese to connect with the rest of the world separately from the nation's state-run media.</br></br>Growing numbers of Vietnamese have launched their own blogs in recent months, where they discuss everything from traditional folk songs and where to buy secondhand iPhones to the corruption that has accompanied a decadelong economic expansion here. One prominent blogger, 60-year-old retired soldier Ng Thuong Thuy, writes forcefully under his own name about injustices in Vietnam's legal systems, especially the explosive issue of land rights which government-controlled media rarely cover.

Adelphia Communications Corp.'s woes continued to mount as the cable concern disclosed it overstated revenue and cash flow by about $500 million over the past two years. Two of the company's newest board members resigned over the "ongoing serial disclosures of wrongdoing" at Adelphia.</br></br>The news comes as Adelphia moves closer to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, something many analysts expect to happen by the end of next week, given Adelphia's cash constraints and a looming $50 million interest payment it must make by Saturday.</br></br>Adelphia has begun discussions with banks about potential bankruptcy financing of as much as $1 billion or more, which would allow the company to continue operating under bankruptcy protection, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adelphia provided some results from its own internal review launched several weeks ago after it was disclosed that the founding Rigas family had benefited from more than $3 billion in loans from the company.</br></br>In its filing, Adelphia blamed former management, which included the Rigas family. The company said that current management believes information provided by prior management, including the amount of the company's cable system that has been rebuilt, "was unreliable" and said Adelphia plans to "correct the information, where material, as current management develops information it considers reliable."

NEW YORK -- The aftermarket has been kind to many of August's underachieving new issues.</br></br>Most of the companies that foundered when they launched their initial public offerings last month have found new life and many market watchers are pointing to this trend as a sign that, when the IPO market returns from its traditional summer slowdown this week, momentum is on its side.</br></br>"We've gotten a little bit of a reprieve from the selloff in August," said Kathy Smith, portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital's IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund in Greenwich, Conn. "Investors are still jittery, but they're definitely feeling better about the near term, and that's so important for the small-cap growth sector."</br></br>This shift in sentiment is seen most clearly in many of the Internet IPOs that had struggled for most of August. Online recruitment company HotJobs.com Inc., for instance, sold 3 million shares at $8 each-below price estimates of $9 to $11and closed at $8 in its first day of trading on Aug. 10, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. The company's shares, though, closed Friday at $26.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Mortgage.com Inc. closed below its $8 offering price when it debuted Aug. 11, but now trades at $16.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</br></br>Even those companies that saw just modest gains in their opening days have had big increases. Homestore.com Inc. closed at $22.75 Aug. 4 after pricing 7 million shares, then barely broke 23 after its first week. The shares closed Friday at $49.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Likewise, Netscout Systems Inc. closed at $13.875, a healthy premium over its $11 offering price, when it debuted Aug. 12. But now the shares stand at $26.625 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Wanted: small investors willing to commit part of their savings to less-developed countries with fast-growing economies and the potential for big returns.</br></br>That, in essence, is the pitch of the first U.S. mutual fund that invests primarily in the government bonds of so-called frontier markets.</br></br>Launched in late February by American Beacon Advisors Inc., an investment firm in Fort Worth, Texas, with $55 billion under management, this fund takes investors to countries such as Venezuela and Rwanda that are one notch lower in economic development than emerging markets like India and China. The mutual fund is managed by Global Evolution, a hedge fund in Denmark.</br></br>The push into frontier markets is the latest effort by money managers to make high-risk, high-return bets more accessible to mom-and-pop investors. Individuals in the U.S. already have the option of investing in a handful of stock funds dedicated to frontier markets.</br></br>Some wealth advisers argue that small investors may be better served putting their retirement savings into more-transparent investments. Even American Beacon advises that its new fund is only appropriate for long-term investors and that the fund shouldn't make up the majority of a portfolio.

Rail workers struck Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., the regional railroad company that last year weathered a strike in an effort to free itself from costly work rules.</br></br>Striking members of the United Transportation Union blamed the walkout on unsafe conditions. But F. Colin Pease, a vice president of Guilford, said the union is protesting the company's recent attempts to make significant improvements in labor productivity.</br></br>Although North Billerica, Mass.-based Guilford operates mainly in New England and is closely held, it has become a pioneer on labor issues. It has launched a campaign to confront the railroad industry's archaic, inefficient work practices and to change federal laws that perpetuate them.</br></br>When track workers struck Guilford in March 1986, the railroad assigned supervisors and nonunion employees to run trains with smaller crews and without expensive work rules. President Reagan two months later created an emergency board to look into the strike, but Congress imposed a settlement favorable to labor.</br></br>Guilford has since made other efficiency moves. Despite fierce opposition from labor, it has transferred much of its system to Springfield Terminal, a small Guilford subsidiary in Springfield, Vt., which employs members of the United Transportation Union but has flexible work rules and lower wages.

LONDON -- Eurodollar bond activity nearly ground to a halt on expectations that the January U.S. trade deficit to be released today widened more than initially forecast.</br></br>Meanwhile, more economic data were released that analysts said confirmed their belief that the U.S. economy will not slip into recession this year.</br></br>Amid bearish news for the dollar markets, new issues emerged in sterling, yen, and European currency units. United Biscuits Finance NV, a unit of the British food concern United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC, launched a well-received offering of #110 million ($203 million) of convertible preference shares.</br></br>Seasoned Eurodollar bonds were marked off about 1/4 point to maintain spreads over U.S. government bonds, but traders reported very little trading activity.</br></br>The U.S. bonds slipped after it was reported that February housing starts increased 8.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 million units. Economists had expected a 5.3% increase.

Corporate restructuring left many American companies leaner in their operations but more heavily in debt. And now, a wave of stock buy-backs, corporate takeovers and sales of companies to their managements is pushing them even further -- perhaps dangerously -- into hock.</br></br>Already, the corporate debt in default is climbing rapidly. The 1981-82 recession raised it, just as you would expect: Annual corporate defaults climbed to more than $840 million from $60 million. But now, despite an economic rebound for more than five years, defaults have, perversely, soared. Last year alone, they reached a towering sum of nearly $9 billion.</br></br>To many analysts' surprise, even the Oct. 19 stock-market crash hasn't discouraged companies from increasing their borrowings. Right after the crash, many companies, despite fears of an impending recession, launched extensive programs to borrow funds and buy back their shares to try to shore up stock prices.</br></br>And in recent months, the merger-and-acquisition mania has broken out again; on Feb. 29 alone, more than $12 billion of takeover plans, mostly involving debt, were announced. Companies may be rushing to buy while the Reagan administration still keeps the antitrust watchdogs on a short leash.</br></br>The borrowing binge has many economists worrying about what may happen in the next recession, which most analysts surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter, expect next year.

OPEC LAUNCHED a major effort to regain control of world oil markets and force prices upward. Twelve of the 13 members agreed to cut production and to sell their oil at fixed prices averaging $18 a barrel. Analysts were split on OPEC's ability to succeed with the new strategy.</br></br>Consumer prices edged up 0.3% in November, suggesting inflation remains well under control.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Claremont Creek Ventures recently had to decide which of its young to forsake.</br></br>The venture-capital firm had invested in such companies as online travel site cFares Inc. and genetic-technology start-up Gene Security Network Inc., with cash from a $130 million venture fund it launched in 2005.</br></br>Amid the financial crisis and the plunging stock market, Claremont Creek decided to focus on the fund's best investments and stop backing the less-promising start-ups. It wanted to be sure it had enough cash for the next few years for the winners. The venture firm ranked the start-ups in the fund's 16-company portfolio with an A, B or C grade.</br></br>"We're doubling down on the As and likely won't invest any more capital in the C companies," says John Steuart, a Claremont Creek managing director. "The portfolio is competing against itself and it's survival of the fittest. It's brutal."</br></br>Gene Security, a fast-growing maker of genetic tests to identify potential abnormalities in embryos, got an A. Last month, Claremont Creek poured $3 million into the company on top of $2.7 million it has already invested.

HOECHST'S PRETAX EARNINGS JUMP</br></br>Hoechst AG, a German chemical company, said group pretax profit for the first quarter jumped 94% to 984 million marks ($715.7 million) from a year earlier. It cited Western Europe's economic recovery, Japan's reviving industrial output and economic growth in the U.S. and in emerging markets. Hoechst told its annual meeting that it expects the favorable earnings trend to continue. The unexpected results pushed Hoechst shares up 4.70 marks, or 1.6%, to 307 marks ($223.28) in Frankfurt.</br></br>BULL CONFIRMS REVENUE DROP</br></br>Cie. des Machines Bull confirmed that its first-quarter revenue fell 10% from a year earlier -- an embarrassment only two weeks after the French computer maker launched a privatization plan with rosy financial forecasts. Bull said the decline was expected and blamed it partly on lower sales at its Zenith Data Systems unit in the U.S., a drop in licensing fees and currency fluctuations. But Bull, which will post its latest results next month, stood by its 1995 forecast for revenue growth and the first annual profit since 1988.

Talk about putting the cart before the horse.</br></br>Most biotechnology companies in the start-up phase stick generally to the business of trying to gain Federal Drug Administration approval for their drugs.</br></br>But Miravant Medical Technologies, an obscure biotech company in Santa Barbara, Calif., which is developing a light0activated treatment for breast and skin cancer, is taking a different approach.</br></br>Before it has even developed a commercially available product, not to mention gaining FDA approval for its light treatment, Miravant has launched a corporate advertising campaign, running two-page spreads in recent weeks in prominent financial magazines and newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal.</br></br>The ads, which also herald a change in the company's name from PDT Inc., announced Sept. 10, are clearly designed to grab Wall Street's attention. "We don't expect a corporate name change to get the attention of investors," said one. "Would a breakthrough in medical technology suffice?".

Some prominent investors say danger is lurking in the decades-old method used to build bond portfolios. If they are right, small investors might want to rethink their strategies.</br></br>The crux: The traditional method of weighting government bonds by "market capitalization" -- the value of a country's bonds in the market -- is leading to risky allocations to highly indebted countries, experts say.</br></br>Instead, some money managers are switching to other measures, such as gross domestic product, that reflect countries' capacity to pay off their debts.</br></br>In March, the managers of Norway's $600 billion sovereign-wealth fund said they would reallocate its government-bond portfolio to reflect the size of countries' GDPs instead of their market caps. That came soon after Citigroup and Research Affiliates launched bond indexes that weight countries by GDP and other measures.</br></br>And in May, Fidelity Investments launched a handful of bond funds with benchmarks that track GDP-weighted bond indexes.

Internet banks have run into all kinds of problems in the U.S., but ING Group NV thinks it has some solutions. Part of its strategy: biscotti and comfy sofas.</br></br>Last month, the big Dutch banking and insurance concern launched its ING Direct Internet bank in the Northeastern U.S. The move was the first phase of a rollout of online banking services across the country that could take several years. In the U.S., ING will be adapting strategies that already are luring many Canadians.</br></br>Starting as a telephone operation, ING Direct in Canada didn't even have Internet service until late 1998. But the online bank already has more than 300,000 clients and over three billion Canadian dollars (US$2 billion) in deposits in the country.</br></br>Like its competitors, ING attracts deposits mainly by offering easy access to accounts and beating traditional banks on interest rates. It is offering a 6.5% rate on U.S. savings accounts, for instance. But unlike many Internet banks, ING Direct targets mainly ordinary consumers rather than computer sophisticates or affluent folk with online brokerage accounts. Then it stretches to put a human face on its machine-based business.</br></br>To help do this, it runs cafes that serve up generous helpings of banking information as well as espresso and biscotti. Among other functions, the cafes calm potential customers worried that their savings will somehow vanish into cyberspace. With its sofa, armchairs and popular music, the cafe on the ground floor of a Toronto office tower looks like any striving-to-be-hip coffeehouse. Giant wooden clogs and a model windmill attest to the bank's Dutch origins.

Regulators have opened investigations into municipalities that may have misled investors about their financial condition, the top official at the Securities and Exchange Commission's municipal-bond enforcement unit said Thursday.</br></br>The unit launched a wide-ranging review of past disclosures by financially stressed states and local governments a little over a year ago, signaling regulators have stepped up scrutiny of municipal-bond sales amid mounting investor anxiety. That review has resulted in an unspecified number of investigations of issuers, said LeeAnn Gaunt, the chief of the municipal securities and public pensions unit at the SEC.</br></br>The unit is looking for instances where there is "tension between the disclosures and the subsequent announcements" of financial stress by municipal bond issuers, Ms. Gaunt said at a National Association of Bond Lawyers conference in Boston.</br></br>She didn't specify which issuers are under investigation.</br></br>The review underscores officials' interest in ensuring proper sales and trading practices in the $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market. The market has long been seen by many mom-and-pop investors as a reliable source of tax-exempt income and a vehicle for retirement savings.

An article yesterday about suppliers to the semiconductor industry incorrectly spelled the name Wacker Siltonic.</br></br>(WSJ July 19, 2002)</br></br>WHEN TIMES are bad in the chip industry, as they are now, there is usually a sector that experiences even more pain -- the companies that supply equipment and materials to semiconductor makers. And they are feeling it now.</br></br>Opening an annual trade show in Silicon Valley, a chip-industry suppliers organization yesterday predicted that revenue for semiconductor-manufacturing equipment would decline 19% this year to $22.8 billion, on the heels of a 41% plunge in 2001. Revenue for materials used in making chips is expected to drop nearly 13% to $22.6 billion in 2002, following a 6% drop last year, the group said.

THE FINANCIAL markets could use a few good inflation watchers these days as soaring oil prices and a strong economy stoke concerns about rising consumer prices. Forecasts reflect the confusion. Among economists who have participated in the survey for at least three years, only nine accurately predicted the inflation rate would slow in 2003, when it dipped below 2%, and then accelerate again in 2004, when it shot up over 3%.

If the U.S. economy keeps growing like it is, Rodney Dangerfield is going to have to rise from the dead and file a patent claim. The expansion that gets no respect keeps cruising along -- past $70 oil, above rising interest rates, and now apparently around even the housing and auto slumps.</br></br>Yesterday's report that fourth quarter GDP rose a healthy 3.5% was predicted by media and Beltway bears in the past four years.

WASHINGTON -- Industrial production fell in December for the third consecutive month, offering bleak news on the state of America's smokestack economy. Mr. Hoffman predicted that autos will continue to be a source of problems in the first quarter and will drag industrial production figures down.

NEW YORK -- The bond market rallied yesterday amid expectations that lackluster economic growth will induce the Federal Reserve to push interest rates lower in coming months.</br></br>Prices of some Treasury bonds rose about three-quarters of a point, or around $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the Treasury's weekly auction of short-term bills. Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc  predicted the Fed will cut the discount rate to 5% by mid-February to try to bolster economic activity. The discount rate, currently 5 1/2%, is the fee charged by the Fed on loans to banks and savings institutions.</br></br>Mr. Platt estimated that the economy is growing at an annual rate of only about 2 1/2% this quarter, compared with a 2.9% rate in the third quarter, after inflation. He expects a still lower 1 1/2% growth rate in next year's first quarter.</br></br>Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc., agreed that the economy "is softening" and that the central bank will ease credit early next year. Elliott Platt also predicted that business activity will expand at a lethargic 2% annual rate in 1987's first quarter. That won't be enough to satisfy Fed officials, who he said would prefer a rate closer to 3%.

NEW YORK -- Interest rates continued to tumble yesterday amid fresh evidence that the economy is losing steam. Yesterday, First Bank Minneapolis trimmed its base rate on corporate loans to 12 1/4% from 12 1/2%. A smaller bank, National City Bank of Minneapolis, went a step further, cutting its rate to 12%. Most major banks currently are quoting a 12 1/2% rate.</br></br> Joseph Bench, a vice president and economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc predicted that they are going to have a 12% prime rate before the month is over and further declines in November to 11 1/2%. He said the Federal Reserve System has eased credit conditions in an attempt to bolster the economy.</br></br>"The Fed is troubled by the abrupt downshift in economic growth, and it doesn't want it to snowball into a recession," he added.

MOST EVERYONE on Wall Street predicted the dollar's three-year bear market would get even worse this year. And, despite its impressive rally in recent months, most are again calling for dollar declines in 2006.</br></br>With the U.S. currency climbing to a fresh two-year high against the euro Friday and hovering around a 26-month best against the yen, there are nascent signs the bearish consensus may be splintering. A few analysts are even arguing that the dollar could strengthen further next year.</br></br>That could have implications for stock investors. Too strong a currency can hurt exporters by making their goods less globally competitive, weighing on earnings. Some fund managers say a stronger dollar could increase stock prices by helping squelch inflationary pressures. That would keep interests rates from rising too quickly and abruptly slowing the economy.</br></br>"We're looking for a continuation of the dollar rally," says Gary Thayer, chief economist for A.G. Edwards and one of the rare dollar bulls at the end of last year. "And we think we're close to a point where others may also start to begin thinking more favorably about the dollar."</br></br>That day may be closer than he suspects. A Dow Jones Newswires survey of 18 banks last week showed a median forecast for a dollar decline of about 9% against the euro and the yen by the end of next year. These dollar forecasts are rosier than ones made three weeks ago, reflecting a broad, if modest, shift in thinking that the dollar can at least hold its gains longer than expected.

In its latest growth forecasts, the European Commission agreed. The European Union's executive body predicted yesterday that growth this quarter would be between 0.1% and 0.4%, from last quarter, and would improve further to 0.4% to 0.7% next quarter. "These forecasts confirm that the slowdown is over but suggest that the recovery will be moderate," the commission said in a statement.</br></br>There is a wrinkle. The budding European economy is also unfolding at different rates in different countries. That isn't unusual for a large region, but part of the problem stems from the euro zone's very reason for being: Europe's common currency regime, which limits how much laggard countries such as Germany can spend to jump-start their economies.

Fannie Mae has had to restate earnings covering the past several years, but the company's economist got his numbers right for this survey. Mr. Berson accurately predicted that the nation's gross domestic product -- the most widely used barometer of economic growth -- would be above the consensus expectation of 3.5% growth in the first quarter of 2005. His forecast was 3.9%; the government reported Wednesday that the actual figure was 3.8%. Mr. Berson also nailed his forecast for the change in the consumer-price index, which advanced 2.8% for the 12 months through May.</br></br>Strong growth and inklings of inflation would normally lead to much higher yields on long-term Treasurys. But it didn't in the first half, and that is what really set Mr. Berson apart from other forecasters. The panel got walloped -- yet again -- by the bond market. The consensus among economists was that 10-year Treasury yields would rise from 4.2% in December to 4.8% by the end of June. But yields declined instead to 3.9%. Mr. Berson said they would rise to only 4.45%, making him less wrong than just about everyone else. He correctly predicted strong growth and a firmer dollar. Rounding out the top five were Mickey Levy of Bank of America Corp., Robert DiClemente of Citigroup Inc. and David Littmann, who retired from Comerica Inc. -- and our survey -- earlier this year.</br></br> James Smith, a University of North Carolina business-school professor who predicted that falling oil prices would push the consumer-price index into negative territory; Bob Shrouds and Robert Fry, DuPont Co. economists who forecast a sharp economic slowdown; and Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford Motor Co.'s chief economist, who predicted weaker growth and rising bond yields. Ironically, another person near the bottom -- David Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch & Co. -- had the best forecast for Treasurys. He said bond yields would drop to 3.8%. But Mr. Rosenberg, one of the more bearish economists on Wall Street, missed the boat by predicting weak growth and much tamer inflation.

Daniel Wantrobski , a Janney Montgomery Scott market technician predicted last week that technology stocks, particularly semiconductors, should outperform the S&P 500.

Health-care premiums paid by employers and their workers rose again in 2008, though more slowly than in recent years, and more employees grappled with deductibles of $1,000 and higher, a nationwide survey showed.</br></br>The average premium rose 5% in 2008, according to an annual poll of nearly 2,000 employers by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. The widely watched barometer of health-care costs, released Wednesday, does offer some faint consolation: The increase wasn't much changed from last year's and a far cry from the 13% to 14% increase of five years ago.</br></br>Another large employer survey released Wednesday, by employee- benefits consultancy Towers Perrin, projected a 6% rise in premiums for 2009. That is in line with a survey by Hewitt Associates earlier this week, which predicted a 6.4% increase in companies' health-care costs next year.

Author: Veronique de Rugy</br></br>From Reason Magazine</br></br>In February, the Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips predicted on ABCNews.com that a Republican proposal in the House of Representatives to cut $61 billion from the federal budget in fiscal year 2011, would, if enacted, shave two full percentage points off America's gross domestic product in the second and third quarters of this year.

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--New applications for unemployment benefits stayed nearly unchanged from last week, showing that the labor market's recent improvement may be slowing.</br></br>Initial jobless claims decreased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000 in the week ended April 21, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires predicted that 376,000 new claims would be filed last week.</br></br>It was the third straight week the level topped 385,000 -- claims haven't stayed that consistently high since November.

South Carolina -- the Southeast's other five states are slowly losing their luster. Just last quarter, the panel of economists predicted growth of 4% for the six-state region.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. recorded a $14.17 billion merchandise trade deficit last month, as exports rose but oil imports surged for the second month in a row, the Commerce Department said. David Berson, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia predicted that the trade balance wouldn't improve significantly until next year.

NEW YORK -- The economy's vigorous rebound since March is threatening to spark renewed inflationary pressures and further increases in interest rates, according to economists and investment managers. This week, the Treasury will auction $16.5 billion of securities, consisting of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Some analysts predicted that the government will have to pay about 13.25% on the 30-year bonds, the highest since a record 14.56% at a February 1982 sale. David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago predicted  that until there is a major reduction in the federal government's budget deficits, investors will demand higher and higher yields as compensation for the risk of inflation.

Most economists in several recent surveys predicted continued economic growth for at least another six months to a year.

Government-bond yields touched new lows in the U.S. and Germany, as investors piled anew into ultrasafe debt amid growing concern about the pace of European growth.</br></br>The gains underscore the dynamics that have made government bonds a surprise star performer this year -- a winning streak many analysts now expect will continue.</br></br>When 2014 started, many Wall Street strategists predicted interest rates would rise, sending bond prices lower, as the U.S. economy picked up speed and the Federal Reserve reduced its monthly stimulus, due to end in October.

Officials Press</br></br>Japan on Rates</br></br>International Monetary Fund officials said Japan's central bank should keep the pace of interest-rate increases "gradual," and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged it not to raise rates until the end of 2008 to ensure an end to deflation.

In 2008, the OECD said, the economy would expand by 2.1%.</br></br>Smoking Banned</br></br>In 75% of Homes

WASHINGTON -- The July employment report did little to ease concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to further reduce inflationary pressures. For some Fed watchers, the jump in nonfarm jobs was the most troubling aspect of the report. Most economists had predicted gains in the range of 200,000 to 230,000 new jobs, well below the actual figure.
While economists have said the U.S. recession ended in late 2001, a fiscal recession continues in America's cities, according to the latest annual survey by the National League of Cities.</br></br>The survey of finance directors from 288 cities found that 63% said their cities were less able to meet financial needs during their fiscal 2004 than in the previous year. Looking ahead, 61% said their cities will be less able to meet financial needs in 2005 than in 2004. (Fiscal years start in January, July, or October depending on the city.) The survey is expected to be released today.</br></br>The financial officers blamed rising costs for employee health benefits, wages, public safety, increased infrastructure needs and employee pensions. The cities' revenues aren't keeping pace with their increased expenses. Cities' 2004 budgets predicted general-fund revenue increasing 2.6% from 2003, with general-fund expenditures expected to rise 3.6%.

LONDON -- Steve Barrow, a currency strategist at Bear, Stearns & Co. in London predicted, would fall toward 75 U.S. cents next year.</br></br>Now Mr. Barrow, a 38-year-old native of East London now says he sees the euro at 95 cents in six months and $1.05 in 12 months.

HERNDON, Va. -- For years, real-estate brokers and home builders promised that the soaring property market eventually would glide to a soft landing. These optimists predicted that home prices, which had more than doubled in parts of the country between 2000 and 2005, would continue to rise, but at a more normal pace of 5% or 6% a year.

Moore, senior vice president and director of research at Argus Research Corp predicted that Treasury bond yields will remain steady or possibly decline about a quarter of a percentage point to around 8 3/4%. But he and numerous other analysts worry that any bond market gains will be short-lived because they anticipate higher inflation later this year.

WASHINGTON -- General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith, who was criticized last year by fellow industrialists for enthusiastically backing tax overhaul, now feels vindicated. "All the bad things that people predicted would happen, didn't happen," he says. Charls Walker, a heavy-industry lobbyist predicted a year ago that the law, which slashed tax rates and trimmed deductions and credits, might cause a recession.

WASHINGTON -- Even as the U.S. trade gap widened in December for the first time in four months, economists said trade is likely to contribute to growth in coming months, as exports continue on an uptrend and oil prices, which surged in December, fall back.</br></br>Economists have long predicted that as economic demand among top U.S. trading partners caught up with rapid U.S. economic growth, the U.S. trade deficit would shrink.

The Agriculture Department trimmed its estimate of the wheat harvest under way across the Southern Plains to account for drought damage, but recent rains have improved crop conditions in much of the Midwest.</br></br>The Agriculture department's June crop report, released Friday, predicted a 1.62 billion-bushel winter-wheat harvest, down 2% from the May forecast and down 5% from last year's actual harvest of 1.7 billion bushels.

Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Rumors of a new, lower-priced Macintosh computer drove options traders to Apple Computer on the first day of trading this year.</br></br>Last week, two independent Web sites reported that Apple will introduce a Mac priced below $600 at the MacWorld Conference & Expo to be held in San Francisco next week. One site, Think Secret, predicted that Apple will launch a Mac priced at $499, sans monitor, on Jan. 11.</br></br>Industry observers say the product would be aimed at personal- computer users who want a second computer to use with their iPod, the hand-held digital-music player made by Apple.</br></br>Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich wrote in a note yesterday that Apple could sell a Mac without a monitor for less than $500 without hurting margins.

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W. Va. -- Chief executives of some of the nation's largest corporations anticipate slower growth for the economy next year and beyond, but are a bit more upbeat about their own companies' outlooks.</br></br>While a lapse back into recession isn't expected, the survey of about 75 CEOs, released yesterday by the Business Council, offered a fairly downbeat assessment for the economy over the next decade.</br></br>For example, 65% of the chief executives predicted the U.S. economy would grow between 1.5% and 3% in 2003, down from the 3.2% annual growth rate in gross domestic product recorded during the first half of this year. They aren't much more optimistic about growth for the next 10 years, with most expecting an average annual pace of 2% to 3%, compared with an average of 3.5% over the past decade.</br></br>For their own firms, slightly more than half of the executives predicted sales growth would accelerate "somewhat," though 18% anticipated either slowing growth or sales declines next year. Many said their companies' profit margins would be stable (43% of respondents) or improve (38%) in the coming year. They are less optimistic about being able to raise prices: Less than one-quarter of participants expected their firms' pricing power to increase.

NEW YORK -- History repeats. When the Greek government first revised up its budget deficit estimates late last year, few predicted it would eventually put the entire euro zone at risk--much as few foresaw the initial subprime mortgage defaults threatening the entire U.S. financial system.

MetLife Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit slumped 74%, mostly because of wider losses tied to its financial-hedging program, but the big life insurer posted a stronger-than-expected gain in operating earnings. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters predicted operating earnings of $1.10 a share and operating revenue of $13.5 billion.

Du Pont Co. and Dow Chemical Co., the two largest U.S. chemical concerns, reported sharply higher fourth-quarter profit and predicted continued improvement through 1984.</br></br>But both companies said the rebound in their chemical operations was offset partly by the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar and weak showings by their petroleum-related businesses.</br></br>Du Pont said fourth-period net income rose 69% to $341 million, or $1.42 a share, from $202 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter's earnings include $30 million of one-time gains, $23 million of which came from settling a claim against Iran over a fibers plant that was expropriated after the 1979 Iranian revolution. The 1982 fourth quarter net is after about $20 million of one-time expenses.</br></br>Fourth-quarter sales increased 8% to $9.08 billion from $8.37 billion.</br></br>Edward G. Jefferson, Du Pont's chairman, said the chemical, plastic, fiber and specialty-product divisions benefited from the U.S. economic recovery, as well as from cost reductions and higher productivity. Du Pont's Conoco Inc. subsidiary's oil and natural gas profit was off, however, because of weak demand and lower prices.

Employers cut jobs in April for the fourth month in a row, but the small size of the drop -- 20,000 jobs -- and a dip in the unemployment rate offered a tentative sign that the U.S. economy might be escaping a deep recession.</br></br>Despite the better-than-expected news, the economy is not healthy. Car sales hit their lowest level in nearly a decade in April, while the fall in home prices is accelerating and consumers are feeling the pain of higher food and energy bills. The decline in the unemployment rate to 5% from 5.1% reflects an increase in part-time jobs. The number of workers with full-time jobs declined.</br></br>The U.S. economy needs to add 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. "You can't lose jobs on a continual basis and have the kind of growth in the economy that you want," said Lehman Brothers economist Drew Matus. He predicted shrinking payrolls for the rest of this year.</br></br>Still, the decline in payrolls in April -- Wall Street forecasters had anticipated an 85,000 drop -- suggests the economic fallout from the housing bust and credit crunch that began last year may be less severe than had been widely assumed as recently as last week.</br></br>The jobs report buoyed an already-rising stock market and strengthened the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell below 12,000 in March, rose 48.20 points Friday, or 0.37%, to close at 13,058.20.

OTTAWA -- Canada's unemployment rate declined in October to its lowest level in eight years, dropping to 8.1% from 8.3% in September, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.</br></br>The stronger-than-expected October job data eased fears that Canada, the largest foreign customer for U.S. goods, was heading toward an early recession. Many analysts had predicted a rise in the October jobless rate.</br></br>Alister Smith, deputy chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said the October report was "really good," showing job strength across industries and regions. He said the job strength supports the bank's view that the Canadian economy will grow at a rate of about 3% through 1998 before slowing to a pace of about 2% in 1999.</br></br>Wojciech Szadurski, Bank of Montreal economist, said the latest job gains "significantly reduce concern about an imminent recession in Canada." These concerns have been heightened by the economic turmoil in Asia and other regions.</br></br>Full-time jobs showed a big gain in October, rising 83,900, or 0.7%, from September. Manufacturing jobs, after declining for three consecutive months, rose 42,700, or 2%, from the previous month. Statistics Canada's latest survey of manufacturers indicated they were more positive about new orders and were planning to increase production in the next three months.

NEW YORK -- When Victor Ganz started collecting Picasso paintings in the 1940s, the art world was a very small place.</br></br>"There were a dozen good galleries, all centered around 57th Street. It was accessible, like a small town in Maine," says Mr. Ganz, sitting in a cozy room hung with seven Picassos. "Everybody knew that Picasso was one of the great painters of the century, but nobody was buying him. Nobody was buying anybody. It wasn't fashionable to buy art."</br></br>Fashions have changed. "There are more people collecting art today as a percentage of the population than ever before, even during the Renaissance," says Leslie Singer, an economist and art historian. Some observers contend that collecting contemporary art has become so trendy that the boom has reached a level of hysteria almost guaranteeing a bust.</br></br>It wasn't supposed to reach this point. When the art market flourished in the late 1970s and early 1980s, economists cited the then-steep inflation and predicted that money would flow out of tangibles when inflation subsided. But in the art world, at least, it didn't happen. People continued to view works of art as good investments.</br></br>Then came the bull market on Wall Street. Art dealers expected the usual slowdown as investors plunged into stocks. But instead, art has become hotter than ever, partly because the securities boom created new legions of wealthy people.

WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's December report on producer prices indicates that inflation remains well under control at the start of the new year.</br></br>The index of producer prices for finished goods rose a substantial 0.4% during the month, or 4.5% at a compounded annual rate, the Labor Department said. But like the larger increases in October and November, the December rise reflected a bulge in food and energy prices that most analysts believe is temporary. Excluding food and energy, producer prices held steady in December.</br></br>"We're entering the year on a very good note," said Joel Popkin, an economic consultant here. "These numbers certainly suggest there is a lot of room to grow before we face inflationary pressures."</br></br>Despite the price bulge during the last three months of the year, the producer price index in December stood only 1.8% above its year-earlier level.</br></br>Some forecasters have predicted that the roughly 20% drop in the dollar's exchange value since last February will cause inflation to accelerate by raising the prices of imports. But the latest producer price figures make it clear that, so far, the dollar's fall is having little effect on prices.

WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes fell 8.1% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000, the lowest pace in a year. Analysts predicted they could drop further in coming months.</br></br>The August decline followed a revised 2.2% decrease in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000, the Commerce Department reported. The department originally had said sales of new single-family homes were unchanged in July.</br></br>The decrease is "in line with expectations for what I think is a moderate decline in construction and new and existing home sales," said Mark Riedy, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "I think we're near the bottom of the decline."</br></br>While Mr. Riedy and several other economists expect new-home sales to drop modestly through year-end, they disagree about next year's outlook because of uncertainty about the mortgage interest-rate picture. New-home sales should total about 665,000 for all 1984, up from 623,000 last year, Mr. Riedy forecast, saying that next year they "may be a little higher" or the same.</br></br>Future new home-sales activity depends on interest rates, and "I don't see much promise of them falling enough" to spark a resurgence of demand, said James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Similarly, Michael Carliner, a senior economist at Chase Econometrics, sees new-home sales dropping to a rate of 590,000 next year from his projected 625,000-unit rate this year, saying there will be "a small surge" in mortgage rates in 1985.

NEW YORK -- The economy's vigorous expansion is threatening to undermine the nation's hard-won gains against inflation, according to a small but growing number of analysts. And that could mean further increases in interest rates.</br></br>In some industries, factories already are operating at close to capacity and price increases are proliferating, these economists said. Although inflation isn't likely to return to double-digit territory, some analysts said they foresee consumer prices rising at a 6%-to-7% annual clip later this year, up sharply from last year's 3.8% increase.</br></br>Moreover, some economists predicted that the U.S. dollar will tumble in the foreign-exchange markets this year. That would make imported goods more expensive in the U.S., intensifying inflationary pressures. As the inflation rate rises, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of the dollar's buying power, these analysts said.</br></br>The dollar's fate "is the wild card in the outlook for inflation and interest rates," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. "The dollar will fall at least 10%" this year against other major currencies, he contended. There is an even chance that the dollar could plunge 20%, he added.</br></br>Mr. Hale predicted that the inflation rate will rise to between 5% and 6% by autumn. The closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which has hovered at about 9 1/2% in recent months, will rise to the 10% to 11% area by year end, he said. The rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other, strongly influences other interest rates.

WASHINGTON -- Mortgage interest rates rose during the past month for the fourth consecutive month, but some analysts predicted the sales-damping rates soon may reach a plateau.</br></br>Lenders last week were quoting an average interest rate of 14.5% on conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was up from 14.08% a month earlier and was the highest since the 14.6% rate for the week of Oct. 15, 1982. The rate was more than 1 1/2 percentage points above the average rate of 12.96% a year earlier.</br></br>Last year's highest rate was 13.89% in the Aug. 19 week. Mortgage interest rates gradually fell after that, bottoming at 13.19% before starting to climb again in late February.</br></br>The basic weekly figures released by Freddie Mac, as the agency is called, refer to 30-year conventional loans for 80% of the purchase price of a new single-family house; they don't include certain initial fees amortized over 10 years. Conventional loans are those that aren't backed by the government.</br></br>Both sales and starts of new housing have been hurt recently by the rising interest rates. New home sales fell an adjusted 4.4% in May, the third consecutive monthly decline. Housing starts dropped 10.5% to a 1,782,000-unit annual rate in May. "The housing recovery? We can play taps for 1984," said Mark Reidy, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.

WASHINGTON -- Business inventories rose 0.7% in July while sales fell 0.5%, the Commerce Department reported, another indication that the economy is vulnerable to recession.</br></br>Economists have been watching inventory levels closely, fearing that if stockpiles of unsold goods grow too high, businesses will cut back on orders and production. With the economy barely growing, the chain reaction could lead to a recession.</br></br>July's rise in inventories followed a 0.5% decline in June.</br></br>The figures "are not worrisome in themselves, but taken with other data seen of late they suggest we are dealing with an economy that is fragile," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co., Chicago, pointing to recent declines in retail sales and housing starts and an increase in the unemployment rate.</br></br>Aubrey Zaffuto, vice president and economist at IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co., New York, predicted there will be a cut in production to offset the growing inventory figures. "People are intolerant of small increases in inventories," she said.

Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>A SURVEY by Blue Chip Economic Indicators found that 70% of respondents believe the recession will end by April. An article yesterday incorrectly reported that 70% of the respondents predicted the recession wouldn't end until April. (WSJ Dec. 12, 2001)</br></br>NEW YORK -- Just two weeks ago, a recession was officially declared to have begun in March. Now a small group of bullish economists is declaring that it already is over, or nearly so.</br></br>The group, led by Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics and Ed Hyman at ISI Group Inc., is decidedly out on a limb. Most other economists are forecasting that the economy will continue to contract during the current quarter, and a recovery will begin in the spring or summer at the earliest. The Federal Reserve, meeting today, is expected to cut its target for short-term interest rates for the eleventh time this year to 1.75% from 2% amid concerns over economic weakness. With unemployment rising and the global economy on the ropes, Fed officials are expected to indicate they remain more inclined to lower rates than raise them.</br></br>There was little reason to be optimistic after Friday's release of the employment report for November. Among other things, the report said the unemployment rate jumped to 5.7% last month -- the highest level in six years -- while the economy lost 331,000 jobs.

This summer's big story strikes all too close to home: the collapse of the subprime-mortgage market and the impact on real-estate values across the country.</br></br>To make sense of the tumult, we turned to Kenneth Heebner, who since 1994 has managed the $1.7 billion CGM Realty Fund. It has the best 10- year record of all real-estate-focused mutual funds, up an average 19.7% a year during the past decade, according to Morningstar Inc.</br></br>We first spoke to Mr. Heebner in July 2006, when he predicted that a swelling number of homeowners would default on risky mortgages, causing a "loud pop" in parts of the country. So how does Mr. Heebner, 66, now view the landscape?</br></br>The bad news is that he is sticking by one of his predictions that has yet to materialize: 50% price declines in some of the once-hottest regions. The good news: He doesn't see a recession ahead, thanks to strong global growth.</br></br>Mr. Heebner is well positioned to talk about prospects for the housing sector. His fund views its mission more broadly than most rivals, so he feels no pressure to make do with the best of a bad, narrowly defined real-estate lot. His fund, for instance, owns more coal-mining stocks than real-estate investment trusts these days. (Coal companies own a lot of land.)

Play it again, Sam.</br></br>For the past two years, currency analysts and traders predicted that a recovering U.S. economy and rising U.S. interest rates, coupled with slowing European economies and lower rates in Europe would spell a stronger dollar. They were wrong.</br></br>Guess what? They're singing the same tune again for 1993.</br></br>"Interest rate differentials will narrow in favor of the dollar. The U.S. economy will grow faster than most of its trading partners. U.S. equity markets look relatively attractive," says Lawrence A. Veit, an international economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. "Some of the political and social uncertainties that exist abroad will not exist in the U.S., and we start from a position of the dollar being undervalued."</br></br>Many of these factors are already behind the dollar's rebound late last year from record lows in September.

WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the U.S. will emphasize the urgency of reviving the global economy at next week's summit in Tokyo, and predicted that Germany will cut interest rates again to that end.</br></br>"You've seen . . . the consensus across Europe that rates should be lowered. Frankly, I think they'll be lowered some more," Mr. Bentsen said in an interview. The German Bundesbank's policy makers meet today, but Mr. Bentsen wouldn't say if he expects an interest-rate cut that soon. Asked if the U.S. will press the Japanese at the summit to do more to stimulate its economy, the secretary replied: "I've never stopped asking."</br></br>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who will meet with the G-7 leaders next week, will come away with far more than his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, got at the London summit two years ago, Mr. Bentsen said. For instance, U.S. officials say the G-7 has agreed to open an office in Moscowo coordinate aid.</br></br>And yesterday, the directors of the International Monetary Fund, as expected, approved a $1.5 billion loan for Russia, the first under a new fund created at the urging of the G-7 to assist Russia and other formerly Communist countries.</br></br>Unable to make as much progress as they had hoped in presummit talks aimed at opening the Japanese market to imports, breaking the deadlock in the world trade talks, and getting other G-7 countries to come up with money for Russia, U.S. officials are now talking about the primacy of economic-growth issues.

WASHINGTON -- The House, in a stunning victory for President Bush, agreed to cut the tax on capital gains, soundly rejecting an alternative proposed by Democratic leaders.</br></br>After weeks of intense lobbying by both sides, the leadership's plan was defeated by a larger-than-expected 239-190 vote. The convincing margin increases the likelihood that a capital gains cut of some sort could become law this year.</br></br>The vote was a blow to the House's newly elected Democratic leadership, particularly Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri. Both had put their personal prestige on the line to defeat the tax-cut measure, which represented their first major showdown with the Bush administration.</br></br>Still, fully one-quarter of their membership -- 64 Democrats -- deserted them and sided with a near-solid phalanx of Republicans. Only one Republican, Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, broke ranks and voted, against the wishes of President Bush, for the Democratic alternative.</br></br>"This was a watershed for us," glowed House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.

WASHINGTON -- More than four years into the economic expansion, wage increases remain modest.</br></br>The Labor Department said yesterday that total compensation costs rose just 2.9% in the 12 months ended in June. That's slightly less than the inflation rate of 3% during the same period. Wage and salary costs were just keeping up with inflation during the year ended in June, and benefit costs were up just 2.7%, the department's employment-cost index indicated. In the second quarter, compensation costs rose 0.7%, slightly more than the 0.6% gain registered in the first quarter. Compensation costs include wages or salary and benefits.</br></br>There are several explanations for the sluggishness of compensation gains: international competition, the decline of labor unions, health-care cost containment, companies subcontracting their extra work and automation.</br></br>"Manufacturing and service companies have really elected to put the squeeze on what they pay their workers," says Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Co. "They've had to."</br></br>The slow increase in compensation costs is all the more surprising when productivity increases are considered. Over the past few years, the trend in productivity growth has been about a half a percentage point more than it was in the 1970s or 1980s. Companies, meanwhile, have become fat with cash from the profits. "Within a year of a meaningful uptick in productivity, we should see a meaningful uptick in wages," Mr. Roach says.

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said officials of the central bank are leaning toward lowering their targets for money-supply growth but haven't yet made the move because they haven't finished studying its implications.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan, appearing before a House Banking subcommittee, said Fed policy makers recently discussed bringing the ranges down another notch "to conform to our long-term goal of price stability." He called the current ranges "still a fraction higher than they should be."</br></br>But the Fed elected to delay such a step, Mr. Greenspan said, until it has a better grasp of the connection between current money-supply figures and the overall economy. "What we did not want to convey to the Congress is that we have some insight . . . that we do not have," he said.</br></br>Asked by panel chairman Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) whether the Fed is "closing in on a better understanding," Mr. Greenspan answered, "Yes." Earlier, he said that the Fed's policy-setting committee would revisit the issue no later than its meeting next February.</br></br>In the past, setting the targets has been a source of tension within the Fed. Hardcore inflation fighters want to lower the targets to underscore the central bank's commitment to bringing down inflation. But other Fed officials, including those who are more concerned about fostering short-term economic growth than further reducing inflation, have resisted.

When Iowa voters walk into their state's caucuses tomorrow night, they will be kicking off a milestone campaign year that promises a new political course for America.</br></br>For the first time in 80 years, no incumbent president or vice president from either party is seeking the White House, creating an unusually unsettled campaign with no obvious front-runner. Power in Congress is divided so evenly between the two parties that neither has really been in control since the 2006 elections. Now, in the wide-open 2008 general election, voters will declare whom they want to run the executive and legislative branches.</br></br>Americans will make that choice at a time when they are distinctly uneasy. Record numbers of voters are choosing to declare themselves politically independent -- and thus open to moving either left or right. Both the Republican president and the Democratic Congress are receiving historically low public-approval ratings, another sign of voter unease. More broadly, the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has in recent months found the nation to be in the midst of the most prolonged period of public dissatisfaction in 15 years, as measured by the share of voters who say the country is "on the wrong track."</br></br>In one sense change is inevitable. This year marks the end of what can be considered the Reagan-Bush era in American politics that began when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980. In six of the last seven general elections, a candidate named Reagan or Bush has appeared atop a national ticket, defining a brand of internationally engaged conservatism that has been the dominant strain in American politics for more than a generation.</br></br>Now the stage is set for an ideological rethinking in both parties. "The mood for change is more than one of small incremental adjustments," write Republican pollster Bill McInturff and Democrat Peter Hart, who conduct the Journal/NBC News poll. "It is concern for the next generation as well as widespread unhappiness with both President Bush and the Congress."

Microsoft's announcement Tuesday of the largest dividend payout in history, $32 billion, followed by a 2% jump in its share price yesterday, is one of those headline-making events that illustrates a larger change. Reacting to last year's tax cut, American companies and investors are rediscovering the virtues of the dividend, which in turn is encouraging investment and powering economic growth.</br></br>The timing of the Microsoft decision tells us something. In paying out a hefty chunk of its cash hoard to shareholders in December, the company was clearly concerned with the possibility that John Kerry might be elected President and carry out his promise to return dividends to their former status as ordinary income (thus raising the dividend tax back to the nearly 40% Clinton-era top rate from today's 15%).</br></br>That sensitivity to change in the tax code jibes with statistics showing that other companies have also reacted to the new incentives. A new paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research documents that the number of firms paying a regular dividend, which had declined steadily for the past two decades, started to rise precipitously last year. Authors Raj Chetty and Emmanuel Saez show that the aggregate level of dividends also jumped, as companies already paying them increased the amounts. The American Shareholders Association has noted the same phenomenon.</br></br>Why is this common sense observation significant? Well, the critics of the Bush dividend tax cut said it wouldn't happen. They argued that corporations don't consider the taxes that their investors face when making decisions about whether to retain earnings or pay them out. Furthermore, stock prices wouldn't be affected. There would thus be no net effect on the level of investment in the economy. The Bush Administration, in this view, was simply putting money into the pockets of the rich without any benefit to the wider economy.</br></br>Well, just as the rising level of dividends and Microsoft's behavior give the lie to this theory, it's worth noting that the stock market hit bottom in March 2003 and began to recover once the tax cut looked like a political certainty. It passed in May. Stock prices reflect the present value of future corporate earnings, and if investors are able to keep more of those earnings it's no surprise that they would value stocks more highly.

WASHINGTON -- Argentina and the International Monetary Fund agreed on an economic program that will provide the country $1.4 billion in loans.</br></br>The IMF lending is linked to the country's achieving mutually agreed-on targets for such economic indicators as its budget deficit and rate of inflation.</br></br>The accord, which is to run until the end of 1990, is to be formally ratified by the IMF's board in coming weeks. The money would boost reserves and help stabilize the economy.</br></br>Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem told reporters early yesterday that the agreement had been reached. This was confirmed several hours later by a person close to the IMF. Details of the agreement weren't disclosed.</br></br>Mr. Menem, who was elected president this year, met yesterday with President Bush. In a statement after the meeting, the White House said President Bush "noted President Menem's determination in dealing with Argentina's economic crisis and stated U.S. support for his program."

NEW YORK -- Favorable inflation data and the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged helped the Treasury market edge higher in listless, range-bound trading.</br></br>Because much of the positive news was already priced into the market, Treasurys didn't react with much enthusiasm to news that buttressed the market's already strong fundamentals.</br></br>The bellwether 30-year bond rose 5/32, or $1.5625 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, at 102 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.956% from 5.967%.</br></br>Shorter-term securities moved little, however. The two-year note, for example, fell 1/32, or $0.313.</br></br>Few market participants were surprised when the Fed's Open Market Committee elected not to change monetary policy during its last policy meeting of the year, keeping the fed funds target rate at 5.50%. The decision was expected because the Fed had provided the market with no indication that it was contemplating a rate change, and because a rate increase would likely have handicapped still-struggling Asian economies.

When New Yorkers elected Bill de Blasio as mayor last year, they knew they were getting a self-styled "progressive" who pledged to soak the rich and shackle the New York Police Department. What they didn't know was that they were also voting to bring Al Sharpton and his influence into the very heart of City Hall. The mayor's alliance with the racial provocateur is now creating the biggest crisis of his mayoralty.

"His agenda is our agenda," AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland declared as he introduced Bill Clinton to labor's cheering throngs in San Francisco on Monday. Did the President cringe?</br></br>The AFL-CIO connection wouldn't seem much of an asset these days. The labor confederation has lost 633,000 members in the past two years and thinks salvation lies in spending $4 million to bludgeon the President on the airwaves about Nafta. Since the last Democrat was elected to the White House, the labor movement has shrunk by seven million souls and nowadays accounts for 10% of the private sector work force.</br></br>Remember the mighty United Mine Workers? Does anybody even know there's a coal strike going on now? The UMW has become a ghetto of low productivity in its own industry, accounting for 41% of the coal miners but only 28% of the coal.</br></br>In Detroit's triennial rigadoon the unspoken question is whether the UAW intends to take General Motors down with it. The union insists on extracting a pound of flesh for each one of the 50,000 jobs GM must shed, even if it means no GM jobs for the next generation.</br></br>Only on the anticompetitive islands of the public sector does labor thrive, having picked up five million new members since 1970.

Crowning the Jesse Unruh State Building, across the street from the Capitol in Sacramento, an inscription declares: "Bring Me Men to Match My Mountains."</br></br>Well, the men who have led California may not always have echoed the inspiring majesty of the Sierras or the rugged power of the Tehachapis. But like it or not, the governors of modern California have been almost perfectly matched to their times. The thoughtful Pat Brown, elected in 1958, earnestly believed in an expansive future, devoting himself to the transportation and education systems that would undergird the California economy. When things seemed to be moving too fast and too far, voters in 1966 replaced Mr. Brown with Ronald Reagan, who promised a return to the homespun values he made famous in his black-and-white movies. His successor in 1974, Jerry Brown, seemed to embody the ambiguity of the '70s, simultaneously preaching lowered expectations and iconoclastic -- some thought reckless -- innovation. Straight-arrow George Deukmejian saw California through the conformist 1980s, while ex-Marine Pete Wilson marched the state past recession and retrenchment in the early '90s.

TAIPEI -- Stocks tumbled 4.9% in Taiwan on continuing worries about bad loans at local banks.</br></br>Most other Asian markets were also weaker, while slumping growth and auto-maker stocks dragged down most European markets. That left the Dow Jones World Stock Index down 1.30%, or 2.84, to 216.05. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 1.07%, or 1.70, to 157.31.</br></br>A series of uncertainties has caused the Taiwan stock market to fall more than 30% since President Chen Shui-bian was elected in March, ousting the long-ruling Kuomintang. Political battles between Mr. Chen and the opposition-controlled legislature have put a question mark over his government's ability to pass crucial legislation. Local banks are faced with rising bad loans, and the extent of the problem isn't known because banks here generally don't follow international standards in reporting such loans.</br></br>With so much uncertainty rattling investors, "any news can be an excuse to sell," said Roger Yang, a fund manager at ABN Amro Asset Management. Mr. Yang said concerns about rising bad loans at local banks were one of the main reasons behind the drop in share prices.</br></br>Separately, the government refused to release the results of a consumer-confidence survey. The decision was reported yesterday in the Economic Daily News, but didn't immediately affect market sentiment. It was the first time since the quarterly survey began in 1998 that it has failed to come out.

WASHINGTON--Coming off one of the most difficult weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama has beefed up his political staff and is expected to deliver an uncompromising State of the Union address. Aides said Sunday that the White House wasn't making any abrupt policy shifts, even as the message was retooled to focus more sharply on job creation.</br></br>If anything, an unfinished agenda from 2009 will grow larger as, in addition to tackling health care and unemployment, the president presses for a bipartisan commission to tackle the budget deficit against resistance from Republicans.</br></br>White House officials said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe would be brought on as a political consultant as the White House gears up for the midterm elections.</br></br>The president's party is facing a stiff headwind from an electorate angry about high unemployment and what they see as ineffectual government, White House officials said. Republican Scott Brown's capture of the Massachusetts Senate seat Tuesday was a first shot in what Democrats worried would be hard-fought contests in November.</br></br>"People are working harder," White House senior adviser David Axelrod said Sunday on ABC's "This Week," referring to the economy. "If they have a job, they're working harder for less. They're falling behind. That's been true for a decade. They look at a wave of irresponsibility from Wall Street to Washington that led to that. And those were the frustrations that got the president elected in the first place, and they were reflected again on Tuesday" in the Massachusetts election.

The abiding cliche about Gerald Ford -- who died Tuesday at age 93 -- is that he was a decent man who steadied the country but held the White House too briefly to leave a major imprint. We've always thought that view of his Presidency is too diminishing, not least because he led the nation at a dangerous time and resisted political furies that could have done the U.S. far more harm.</br></br>"America's Suicide Attempt" is how the historian Paul Johnson describes the 1970s. And it is important to recall the bad temper of the times that Ford inherited in becoming the 38th President. He succeeded Richard Nixon, who had resigned over the Watergate coverup and amid an unpopular war in Vietnam. He faced large liberal majorities in Congress that were emboldened by their ouster of Nixon and set to revive the Great Society. And he had to clean up the financial problems caused by a burst of inflation and wage and price controls. Ford navigated all of these traumas better than he gets credit for.</br></br>---</br></br>It is true that Ford was something of an accidental President, the only one in U.S. history never elected as either President or Vice President. Before Nixon picked him to replace the disgraced Spiro Agnew as his Vice President, Ford had been contemplating retirement from his Grand Rapids, Michigan, House seat. But like another unlikely President from the Midwest, Harry Truman, he had reserves of honesty and fortitude that served him well.</br></br>He made a particular contribution in pardoning Nixon, though he knew Nixon's enemies would accuse him of a quid pro quo. The decision cost him dearly in the polls and may have cost him the election in 1976, but it also spared the country from years of division over a criminal trial that special prosecutor Leon Jaworski seemed determined to pursue.

WASHINGTON -- Although the unemployment rate dropped sharply in May, employment statistics for the month indicate the economy was growing much more slowly than in April.</br></br>Civilian unemployment fell to 7.5% of the work force in May after sticking at 7.8% in March and April, the Labor Department said. A separate measure, which includes members of the military among the employed, dropped to 7.4% in May from 7.7%.</br></br>The drop returned the jobless rate to its level of November 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president. Any further declines in the coming months will enable the president to claim during his reelection campaign that his administration brought down both inflation and unemployment.</br></br>But the decline of the unemployment rate is more a reflection of the economy's previous strength than of its strength in May. While employment rose sharply during the month, the number of hours worked by the average employee declined from the unusually high level of April, and average earnings also declined. That suggests industrial production and personal income rose modestly in May, if at all.</br></br>"We just exchanged bodies for hours," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. "May was a standstill month. In real GNP (gross national product), we are talking no change."

Your editorial " A Barack Market" (Nov. 13) is on the mark. When a president-elect cannot say, in a bear market and a with recession on the horizon, whether he and his party will or will not raise any taxes it is at best an indicator that he has no knowledge or appreciation of capitalism and the markets, or at worst a cynical attempt to further weaken the public's confidence in both.</br></br>Barack Obama and the Democrats will be unable to contain their pent-up desire to spend money on union bailouts (i.e., automobile companies) and other favored constituents, pay off MoveOn.org, Code Pink and all the other various groups that helped them get elected and raise taxes on the evil rich.</br></br>Stephen J. McCann</br></br>Salisbury, Md.

Mike Synar, 45, the brash, bright and buoyant Oklahoman who represented the people of his state's 2nd District in the U.S. House of Representatives for eight terms before losing the Democratic primary for renomination in 1994, died of brain cancer Jan. 9 at his home in Washington. The cancer had been diagnosed in July 1995.</br></br>Mr. Synar, a lawyer, rancher and real estate broker from a prominent ranching family in conservative northeast Oklahoma, was first elected to the House in 1978.</br></br>During his years in Congress, he vigorously supported campaign finance reform, stricter gun control and environmental legislation. He also voted for higher grazing fees for cattle on public lands, and he seemed to find himself in opposition to the tobacco industry, ranchers and the gun lobbies.</br></br>In the 99th Congress, Mr. Synar led the House opposition to the Gramm-Rudman plan to reduce the budget deficit, a measure favored by conservatives and thought to be immensely popular in a district such as his. After losing the fight in Congress, Mr. Synar helped start legal challenges to the plan, which helped lead to a portion of the law being declared unconstitutional.</br></br>His stands were thought to be anathema to his conservative constituents, but they continued to back Mr. Synar until 1994. That year, he was upset in a primary runoff by a retired teacher, who went on to lose to Republican Tom Coburn, an obstetrician, in the general election.

THE NEW SEASON A Spectator's Guide to the 1988 Election By George F. Will Simon and Schuster. 223 pp. $17.95</br></br>IN THESE four essays, George F. Will, political commentator and Chicago Cub loyalist, provides an elegant intellectual context for the forthcoming presidential campaign. His approach to politics is much the same as to baseball: "Politics is not everything, but it is something. It is something good, and agreeable, and fun, and serious."</br></br>In this civilized spirit, Will deprecates excessive passion and takes the long view. Quoting Earl Weaver, the former manager of the Baltimore Orioles who said: "This ain't a football game. We do this every day." Will adds: "Baseball's best teams lose about sixty-five times a season. It is not game you can play with your teeth clenched."</br></br>I am not sure I agree. As a Boston Red Sox man, a condition only a shade less masochistic than being a Cub fan, I found my teeth clenched frequently during the 1986 World Series. Many Democrats, whose party has lost four of the last five presidential elections, may also find it more difficult to stay as loose and amiable as Will, whose benevolence toward Ronald Reagan and the Grand Old Party is well-known. This book is dedicated to former U.S. senator Gordon Allott of Colorado, for whom Will once toiled as a young legislative assistant. Allott was first elected to the Senate by means of a nasty bit of red-baiting in 1954, a year when Richard Nixon was working his anti-communist hustle in the mountain states. Allott, a basically decent if uninspired conservative, was always slightly embarrassed by the dingy circumstances surrounding his first election. Suitably enough, he disappeared from the Senate in 1972, partly because Nixon in that year of the China visit and the Moscow summit (and Watergate) was so grand that he did not deign to campaign for anyone, not even himself.</br></br>There is no gross partisanship in Will's comments, and there is much good sense and even wisdom. Will is a conservative in the school of Edmund Burke. He recognizes that government is necessary, respects tradition and has a skeptical if not pessimistic view of what human beings can accomplish to change the human condition. He rightly chastises Reagan for frequently citing Thomas Paine's most un-conservative thought that we can make the world anew. In short, Will is not a libertarian or a radical right-winger who believes that a revival of the gold standard or one more giant tax cut will usher in utopia.

Deputy President Frederik W. de Klerk said tonight that he was "viciously insulted" during a cabinet debate over an amnesty for crimes committed by police and security ministers during the apartheid era of white-minority rule.</br></br>The dispute over amnesty marks the first real rift in the multi-party and multiracial government that came to power under President Nelson Mandela following South Africa's historic democratic election last April. It was not seen as a coalition-breaker, however, and de Klerk stopped short of threatening to quit the government.</br></br>Rumors that de Klerk might pull his former ruling National Party out of the cabinet - where it holds a deputy presidency and six of 27 ministries - raced through political and business circles today, setting off a minor tremor on the stock market. But in a speech tonight to a National Party congress, de Klerk said that while he had considered resigning in the face of a dressing down in Wednesday's cabinet meeting by Mandela, he concluded that South Africa's fragile transition to democracy demands that all major parties work together.</br></br>De Klerk, who was president when Mandela was elected, said he and his party will oppose a cabinet decision that invalidated the controversial amnesty, which was granted under the de Klerk government just before last April's election. He also issued a veiled demand for an apology from Mandela, insisting that the leadership of Mandela's African National Congress "take appropriate steps, without delay, to remedy the unfair, unjustified and unacceptable attack on our integrity and good faith."</br></br>De Klerk and Mandela are expected to meet Friday to try to patch up what has become a badly damaged relationship.

Randall W. Byrnes volunteered to undertake an almost impossible mission after being elected president of the Northern Virginia chapter of the National Association of Industrial & Office Parks.</br></br>For several months now, Byrnes has been trying to get developers of big commercial projects in Northern Virginia to slow the pace of construction. Northern Virginia simply doesn't need as much office space as developers have been producing, Byrnes has been telling members of NOVA/NAIOP. Convincing builders that he's right hasn't been easy, however. Few are willing to let the bandwagon pass them by. "Let's face it, it's not fun to be in the development business and not build," Byrnes quipped in a recent interview.</br></br>He is serious, nonetheless, about the need to adhere more closely to the supply-demand rule. Unless developers do just that, Byrnes warns, this market could become overbuilt as so many others have. Indeed, the local market may be undergoing a structural change and not a cyclical one, he said.</br></br>Byrnes' warnings can't be dismissed simply as part of another no-growth crusade by Northern Virginia politicians and taxpayers. He is, after all, senior vice president and regional manager for Spaulding & Slye, a leading investment builder headquartered in Boston. Credibility, then, should not be a drawback to his argument against overbuilding.</br></br>"There is a potential here for a very real and serious overcapacity problem," he warned after the metropolitan Washington Council of Governments released a report last week showing a big surge in commercial construction indicators.

On the day after Prince George's County Executive Jack B. Johnson was reelected in 2006 - the fourth time that residents had elected him to a countywide position - he wearily explained what accounted for his victory.</br></br>Dogged for years by reports that state and federal authorities were investigating his relationships with developers and his hiring of friends for public office, Johnson will leave office next month a deeply polarizing figure.</br></br>His detractors have long said his style of politics hurts the county's image and its efforts to spur business.</br></br>For critics, that impression will be cemented by Johnson's arrest Friday, along with his wife, Leslie, just three weeks before his final term in office is to end. He was charged with destroying evidence and witness tampering.</br></br>But for his supporters, he has remained a popular figure - an unfailing campaigner with an unparalleled ability to connect with voters. They were inspired by Johnson's life story - he grew up poor in rural and segregated South Carolina only to graduate from Howard Law School and get elected to lead the nation's wealthiest majority-African-American jurisdiction.

Adelphia Communications Corp.'s woes continued to mount as the cable concern disclosed it overstated revenue and cash flow by about $500 million over the past two years. Two of the company's newest board members resigned over the "ongoing serial disclosures of wrongdoing" at Adelphia.</br></br>The news comes as Adelphia moves closer to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, something many analysts expect to happen by the end of next week, given Adelphia's cash constraints and a looming $50 million interest payment it must make by Saturday.</br></br>Adelphia has begun discussions with banks about potential bankruptcy financing of as much as $1 billion or more, which would allow the company to continue operating under bankruptcy protection, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adelphia provided some results from its own internal review launched several weeks ago after it was disclosed that the founding Rigas family had benefited from more than $3 billion in loans from the company.</br></br>In its filing, Adelphia blamed former management, which included the Rigas family. The company said that current management believes information provided by prior management, including the amount of the company's cable system that has been rebuilt, "was unreliable" and said Adelphia plans to "correct the information, where material, as current management develops information it considers reliable."
STOCKS SLUMPED as investors resigned themselves to the probability of another interest-rate increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 46.77 to 3882.21. Worries about interest rates and inflation also drove bond prices lower. Helping to depress markets was concern that political opposition in Congress could stall a planned rescue package for Mexico.</br></br>Mexican stock prices sank 4.8% and the peso fell 2.7% against the dollar on nervousness about U.S. approval of the rescue package.</br></br>---</br></br>Tele-Communications and Comcast notified regulators that they plan to complete their $1.42 billion acquisition of QVC as early as next month despite possible antitrust objections.</br></br>---
BOSTON -- The Christian Science Monitor's editor, Katherine Fanning, resigned along with her two top assistants to protest a restructuring they say will weaken the paper.</br></br>The restructuring will include staff cuts and other cost-reducing measures. It is aimed at narrowing the newspaper's losses at a time when the Christian Science Church, which owns the paper, faces financial strains from heavy outlays for a new television news program and a reduction in working funds because of the stock-market crash. A new format being considered for the Monitor would reduce the paper to 16 pages from its 28-page average, a church official said. The Monitor may also eliminate advertising.</br></br>As part of the restructuring, Richard A. Nenneman, formerly general manager of print publishing for the Monitor, will become editor-in-chief in charge of all of the church's news operations, a new position. Richard J. Cattani, formerly the Monitor's editorial page editor, succeeds Ms. Fanning as editor.</br></br>The Monitor's managing editor, David Anable, and assistant managing editor, David Winder, also resigned. In a letter to church leaders criticizing the restructuring plan, Mr. Anable said the plan calls for a 50% staff reduction and a "new desk-top, advertising-less version" of the Monitor that was presented to church leaders before the paper's editors had a chance to review it.</br></br>Ms. Fanning, 61 years old, assumed her post at the Monitor in 1983 after serving as editor and publisher of the Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News, which she led to a Pulitzer Prize in 1976. While she was editor of the Monitor, its circulation rose to about 170,000 from about 150,000; it peaked at about 300,000 a few decades ago. She recently served as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
Stock and bond markets rebounded sharply in what many analysts said were technical rallies following sustained declines.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 47.30 points to 2590.54 in active trading. And the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed one point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount.</br></br>The dollar, meanwhile, slid back from levels reached in Tuesday's big rally. That rally was triggered by subsequently denied rumors that Mikhail Gorbachev was considering resigning as head of the Soviet Communist Party.</br></br>Analysts were skeptical about the nature of the stock and bond market rallies, noting that investors and traders in each market sought out reasons to be optimistic and ignored evidence to the contrary.</br></br>The stock market rally, for instance, began at the opening bell after an early-morning report that the index of leading economic indicators for December rose much more than expected. Investors concluded the economy isn't as weak -- and corporate earnings not as likely to decline -- as they had suspected. But investors chose to ignore a later report that showed new home sales at their lowest levels in five years, evidence that a large sector of the economy remains very weak.
NEW YORK -- Some Merrill Lynch & Co. executives used to mock the viability of online stock trading. Now, one of the firm's top executives is poised to run Ameritrade Holding Corp., one of the nation's largest online brokerage firms.</br></br>Joseph Moglia, a senior vice president in Merrill's private-client group, is expected to be named chief executive of Ameritrade, according to people close to the matter. The announcement could come as early as today.</br></br>Mr. Moglia didn't return a telephone call for comment, and Ameritrade spokesman Larry Marchese declined to comment on the matter.</br></br>Mr. Moglia would take the post vacated in August when Tom Lewis resigned. Since then, Ameritrade's founder, J. Joe Ricketts, has served as CEO, but he told shareholders at the recent annual meeting that he is looking forward to handing the job over to a permanent chief executive.</br></br>The move, though, is somewhat ironic given Merrill's past opposition to online trading. The former head of its brokerage business, John "Launny" Steffens, was once quoted disparaging what he called "the do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet trading."
A management shake-up at Volkswagen AG is putting more power in the hands of its engineering-minded new chief executive officer, Martin Winterkorn, and raising concerns among investors about how aggressively Europe's largest auto maker will continue to cut costs.</br></br>Europe's largest auto maker by vehicles sold said yesterday that the head of its core VW brand, Wolfgang Bernhard, would leave the company "by mutual consent" effective Jan. 31, less than two years after taking office and roughly two months after then-CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder abruptly resigned. Mr. Pischetsrieder had clashed with Volkswagen Chairman Ferdinand Piech over the company's strategy and governance.</br></br>Mr. Winterkorn, who officially became CEO of Volkswagen Jan. 1, couldn't be reached to comment and has said little publicly about his plans for leading the company. While Mr. Winterkorn has garnered praise for increasing Audi's sales in recent years, investors question whether he will bring the same energy to cost cutting as Mr. Bernhard, who had taken a prominent role in the effort.</br></br>Volkswagen said in a statement yesterday that its new management structure "opens the way for greater synergies" within the company. An aide at the company's communications department said its representatives were traveling back to Germany from the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and weren't available to comment.</br></br>Mr. Winterkorn will now lead the VW brand and oversee research and development for the company. Volkswagen also reorganized its brands, putting luxury nameplates Audi, Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini together in one division, and mass-market brands VW, Seat and Skoda in another.
MINNEAPOLIS -- K-tel International Inc.'s president resigned from his post at the company two months ago, and was succeeded by a relative of K-tel's founder and biggest stockholder.</br></br>Separately, K-tel's often volatile shares nearly doubled yesterday, soaring $6.375 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, to $13.25. Volume was extremely heavy, with 16.6 million shares changing hands; that number represents roughly two times the 8.34 million common of K-tel shares outstanding as of Sept. 30. The stock's surge was spurred by the disclosure yesterday of an agreement between K-tel and Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s online unit, under which they will jointly develop an online music store at Playboy's Internet Web site.</br></br>The marketer of entertainment and consumer products said 41-year-old David Weiner, who had served as president since 1996, resigned Sept. 4 "to pursue other interests." K-tel named as its new president Lawrence Kieves, 50, who was formerly managing director of closely held EWK Associates, a real-estate development concern. Mr. Kieves served previously as chief operating officer of Network Event Theater Inc., a publicly traded campus media and marketing concern.</br></br>Mr. Kieves, the company noted, is a "first cousin, once removed," of K-tel's 69-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, Philip Kives. Mr. Kives, who founded K-tel in 1968, holds about a 42% stake in the company.</br></br>A K-tel spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the reasons behind Mr. Weiner's departure, and Mr. Weiner couldn't be reached for comment. K-tel's spokeswoman also declined to discuss why the company, although it had previously disclosed the management changes in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, had waited so long before issuing a public statement about the departure of its No. 2 official.
VIACOM AND QVC each increased slightly their offers for Paramount, moments before the deadline. QVC raised the cash portion of its offer to $104 a share from $92, but reduced the amount of QVC stock in the bid. Viacom left the cash portion of its offer unchanged at $107 a share, but boosted the value of securities being offered. Many traders said the contest was too close to call, although several said Viacom still retained a slight edge.</br></br>A healthy rise in orders helped the manufacturing sector expand again in January, according to a survey of purchasing managers, but the growth brought along new hints of inflation.</br></br>Bond prices plunged on the strong manufacturing activity report. The Treasury's 30-year issue lost over 1 point and its yield was 6.31%. The Dow Jones industrials fell 14.35 to 3964.01.</br></br>---</br></br>The Federal Reserve Board's David Mullins resigned as vice chairman. The move coincides with the end of Wayne Angell's term, allowing Clinton to fill two of the Fed's seven seats as it is deciding when and how much to raise short-term interest rates.
Stock-market investors, surprised by the quick delivery of a special prosecutor's report late Wednesday, found themselves sharing some of President Clinton's pain yesterday.</br></br>But while more could be in store in the event of a protracted battle over Mr. Clinton's future, some Wall Street strategists say the market has a salve: the continued presence of Robert Rubin as Treasury secretary and Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chief.</br></br>"It is times like these that you value people like Greenspan and Rubin, and we've got to make sure Thomas Galvin doesn't resign or we're really in the soup," says Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.</br></br>Market strategists and other experts were quick to point to such factors that could cushion the market from the impact of scenarios ranging from censure to resignation to a full-blown impeachment proceeding stemming from the president's relationship with a White House intern.</br></br>"For the financial markets, the most important thing is that Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Rubin are still there, and are visible and active," says Prudential Securities market strategist Greg Smith. And in that case, "I don't think there will be quite the sense of hopelessness that nobody is in charge." In the end, he adds, unless the Clinton affair prompts either of those two "to resign or be ineffective," the president's problems are largely "an unpleasant side show."
Burger King, trying to combat the recession and appease unhappy franchisees, plans to increase its media advertising budget by cutting back on other marketing expenses, executives close to the company said.</br></br>The company wants to pour most of its beefed-up budget into network television, the executives said.</br></br>A Burger King spokeswoman wouldn't comment specifically, but she conceded that "we are looking at various ways to become more effective in marketing, which includes taking a look at our TV advertising and how we buy {advertising} across the board." But she declined to elaborate, saying details are "highly confidential, proprietary and very competitive."</br></br>The No. 2 fast food chain, like most of its competitors, has been struggling with declining traffic and sales at its restaurants. At the same time, franchisees have been openly miserable over the "Sometimes you've gotta break the rules" campaign. The chain's top ad executive, Gary Langstaff, resigned late last month; he has been succeeded temporarily by Barry J. Gibbons, chief executive officer of Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC.</br></br>The impetus to bolster ad spending comes directly from Mr. Gibbons, who began revamping ad plans immediately after Mr. Langstaff's departure, industry executives said. The extra ad muscle would support a new campaign breaking in April or May, with the probable new slogan, "Your Way. Right Away," they said.
Profit-taking pushed stock prices lower in a lethargic day. Bond prices edged a little higher and the dollar gained.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 13.20 to 3026.16 in slow trading. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.79 to 393.06. But small stocks continued creeping to new highs. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.37 to 521.75.</br></br>Ralph Bloch, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, ascribed the stock market's modest losses to Mikhail Gorbachev's threat to resign if the independence movement in the Soviet Union continued.</br></br>"I thought we'd see a repeat of Monday when there was no real selling pressure, with maybe a rally try late in the day," he said. "But then Gorbachev threatened to resign and stocks dropped. I don't know why the market responded as it did, since it's no big deal. Gorbachev is still a week behind everybody else."</br></br>But Mr. Bloch said selling pressure wasn't very heavy yesterday. "It was more a case of buyers stepping back than any real across-the-board selling," he said. "It almost strikes me that Gorbachev's statement gave buyers an excuse to step back."
The chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., the world's biggest company, resigned today under fire for alleged involvement in a scandal that has spread throughout Japan's political and business world.</br></br>The minister of posts and telecommunications, Masaaki Nakayama, told a news conference he had accepted the resignation of Hisashi Shinto as NTT chairman.</br></br>Nakayama said Shinto had denied any personal involvement in dubious share trading but had accepted responsibility for actions by his personal secretary.</br></br>Japanese press reports said prosecutors had traced some 10 million Japanese yen, or around $81,000, to Shinto's bank account from proceeds of the sale of shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of the Recruit conglomerate.</br></br>Shinto on Tuesday had issued a statement denying involvement in the share transaction, which was carried out by his personal secretary, Kozo Murata, in 1986. Murata has since resigned as Shinto's aide.
"; A group of labor unions is sponsoring a voter initiative to restore recent cuts in the District‰Ûªs unemployment compensation benefits, but an unlikely combination of business and labor officials strongly opposes (;he measure.</br></br>; The Food and Allied Service Trades Council (FAST) last week filed with the P.C. Board of Elections and Ethics a proposed initiative that would eliminate the Current $206 weekly cap on benefits, increase taxes on most employers by about $20 to $35 for each employe, guarantee jobless persons 39 weeks of benefits, and restore benefits for workers who voluntarily resign jobs or are fired for cause.</br></br>*	FAST, a coalition of five local unions representing about 45,000 food-service and hotel employes in the region, is seeking to overturn many of the cuts proposed by hlayor Marion Barry and approved by the</br></br>D.G. City Council last March in an attempt to reduce a $57 million deficit in the city‰Ûªs unemployment compensation fund.</br></br>passed a law which cuts workers‰Ûª benefits too steeply, while failing to tax employers adequately, said Ron Richardson, secretary-treasurer of Local 25 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employes Union."
Darcy Bradbury, assistant treasury secretary for financial markets, will resign early in October to return to the private sector. Bradbury advises Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and other senior officials on federal debt management. She also projects the government's short- and long-term borrowing needs, helps set Treasury auction rules and the types of securities to be sold. A Treasury official said Bradbury, a former investment banker who lives with her husband and two sons in New York, "will pursue opportunities on Wall Street." No replacement has yet been named but Roger Anderson, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, will assume her duties.</br></br>Chrysler Chief Executive Robert Eaton said he expected the company's next labor contract with the United Auto Workers to have more in common with Ford's UAW pact than with Chrysler's own recent agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers union. Its tentative agreement with the CAW limits the automaker's ability to eliminate jobs through shifting work to outside suppliers.</br></br>General Magic, an Internet software producer, said that Marc Porat plans to step down as chief executive, and Robert Kelsch has resigned as president. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company said the functions of president, CEO and chairman will be combined into a single position, which will be immediately filled by Steve Markman, who had been executive vice president and general manager of the Novell products group.</br></br>Mortgage rates fell this week. A Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. survey showed the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 8.14 percent this week from 8.28 percent last week. Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages fell to 7.64 percent from 7.81 percent, and the average initial rate on adjustable-rate loans fell to 5.83 percent from 5.90 percent.</br></br>Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced a new task force to guide the government in supporting and regulating the revolution in electronic money: "smart" cards, debit cards, electronic benefits transfer and other services. The panel will include members of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the FTC. Rubin compared the industry's changes to "when the agricultural age ended and the industrial age began."
Rusty Paul, one of the many Bush appointees wrapping up loose ends, packing bags and getting out of town, has one thing to offer the Clinton people: a four-bedroom house in Annapolis.</br></br>Paul, 40, who came to Washington four years ago to work in Jack Kemp's Department of Housing and Urban Development, has prepared this ad to run in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette: "Disappointed, disillusioned GOPer with only one asset an incoming Clintonite might want: 4-BDRM, 2 1/2 BA. house with a great water view and access . . . shorter commute than N. Va. Better parking than G'twn. Less Crime than Cap. Hill."</br></br>Paul, his wife, Jan, 41, and children are leaving behind the monuments, the power, the swiveling leather chairs, the Capitol Hill parties, the people who are nice to him "because they want something" and a view of Beards Creek, off the South River, to return to Atlanta - back to "grits and gravy."</br></br>It is a move they began preparing for even before the election, when Rusty, in his travels with Kemp, detected that voters were unhappy. Jan started one morning after she heard on a TV talk show that Bush would ask for the immediate resignations of all his appointees if he was reelected.</br></br>Either way, it looked like Rusty Paul would be out of his $112,000- a-year job as assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental relations for HUD. "That hit like a ton of bricks," said Jan, who had lost her own computer sales job to the recession two years ago. "It was like a sudden jolt, `Hey, we better figure out what we are going to do with everything we own.' If he's asking for resignations, we better snap to it . . . just in case."
The stock of Dart Group, the Landover-based owner of Crown Books, Trak Auto, Total Beverage and part of Shoppers Food Warehouse, rose $11.12 1/2, or 13 percent, to close at $95 on the Nasdaq stock market. Investors responded to an agreement, announced after the market closed last Friday, under which outside directors of Dart would remove control of the company from the feuding Haft family. Trading had been halted until midday yesterday.</br></br>CoreStates Financial and Meridian Bancorp agreed to a $3.2 billion merger. CoreStates, of Philadelphia, has $29.3 billion in assets and about 355 branches in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Meridian, based in Reading, Pa., has $15 billion in assets and more than 300 branches in those two states and Delaware. The merged company will become the nation's 19th-largest bank, as measured by its $44.3 billion in assets.</br></br>T-bill rates fell. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 5.31 percent from 5.34 percent last week. Rates on six-month bills fell to 5.32 percent from 5.38 percent. The actual return to investors is 5.47 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,865.80, and 5.56 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,731.00. Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 5.61 percent last week from 5.69 percent the previous week.</br></br>A key union negotiator at USAir has resigned his union post. Pete Gauthier, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association master executive council at USAir Group, said two recent events made it a "natural" time for a change in the union's leadership. Arlington-based USAir ended talks with its unions in July that would have swapped a stake in the company for $2.45 billion in wage concessions over five years. And it said last week that it has held talks with United and American airlines about a possible alliance or acquisition.</br></br>Healthsouth of Birmingham, the largest U.S. provider of rehabilitation services, said it will buy Surgical Care Affiliates of Nashville, the biggest outpatient surgery firm, in a $1.2 billion stock swap. The deal extends a series of acquisitions by Healthsouth as it seeks to marry the two medical services and offer them on a nationwide scale.
Richard I. Linhart, who was hired as chief executive and chairman of Reston-based Millennium Bankshares in 2007 to help turn the struggling company's operations around, will resign at the end of the month.</br></br>Linhart, a longtime local banker, has led the company through a period of increased scrutiny from regulators as the housing downturn has taken a toll on Millennium's finances.</br></br>The company, which operates four branches of Millennium Bank in Northern Virginia, said in a statement that Linhart resigned for "personal reasons" and intends to retire. John F. Novak, executive vice president and chief operating officer, will succeed him. Neither Linhart nor Novak returned calls for further comment.</br></br>"Dick Linhart has done a great job in leading the bank through some very rough patches," Novak said in the company's statement. "Hopefully, with the groundwork laid and the vision clearly defined, the organization can move more quickly toward becoming, once again, a competitive, profitable community bank in Northern Virginia."</br></br>In January 2008, the company disclosed that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had ordered it to improve its financial condition. In June, the bank said it had signed an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in which it agreed to get approval before paying cash dividends, making quarterly interest payments on some of its securities, adding directors and making certain promotions.
An unusually large share of workers have been out a job for more than six months even as overall unemployment has remained low, a little-noted weakness in the labor market that analysts said threatens to intensify the impact of the unfolding economic downturn.</br></br>In November, nearly 1.4 million people -- almost one in five of those unemployed -- had been jobless for at least 27 weeks, the juncture when unemployment insurance benefits end for most recipients. That is about twice the level of long-term unemployment before the 2001 recession.</br></br>The problem is ensnaring a broader swath of workers than before. Once concentrated among manufacturing workers and those with little work history, education or skills, long-term unemployment is growing most rapidly among white-collar and college-educated workers with long work experience, studies have found, making the problem difficult for policymakers to address even as it grows more urgent.</br></br>"What has happened is a polarization of the labor market. It was very strong at the very top and very strong until recently at the bottom," said Lawrence F. Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University. "But in the recent weak recovery, and now recession, demand has been very weak" for jobs in the middle.</br></br>Caroline Dixon never contemplated any of that when she resigned in April after nine months as a program officer with the Spina Bifida Association. She left because the job was "a bad fit," and she said she was confident that the economy was strong and she would soon find work. For a long time, she never stopped in the unemployment office on Naylor Road near her Southeast Washington home.
Veteran Ward 8 political activist Philip E. Pannell finally found work after 19 months in the unemployment wilderness. But after just three weeks on the job, Pannell resigned in anger, accusing his new employer -- a nonprofit organization that serves public charter schools -- of improperly forbidding him to campaign against Ward 7 council member Kevin P. Chavous.</br></br>The way Pannell tells it, he was hired in late May to serve as outreach coordinator for the PCS Center for Student Support Services, which informs D.C. residents about education options in the public school system.</br></br>Three days after he started work, the center's executive director, Eve Brooks, got a call from an aide to Chavous, who chairs the council's education committee.</br></br>The aide informed Brooks that Chavous was "really angry that I'd been hired," Pannell said. Pannell has long maintained an adversarial relationship with Chavous. Most recently, he helped engineer a takeover of the Ward 7 Democrats on behalf of Vincent Gray, Chavous's strongest challenger in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary.</br></br>Pannell said Brooks told him to be careful because "Chavous is a good friend of charter schools." Pannell said Brooks also threatened to fire him "if I find out you're doing anything for Vince Gray."
An item in the National Briefing of the March 9 Business section gave an incorrect figure for the net worth of U.S. households in the fourth quarter of 2006. It is $55.6 trillion. (Published 3/10/2007)</br></br>The net worth of U.S. households -- the difference between total assets and total liabilities -- climbed to a record high of $55.6 billion in the final quarter of last year, boosted mostly by gains in stocks, the Federal Reserve said. For all of 2006, households' net worth rose by 7.4 percent, slower than the 7.9 percent increase in 2005. Household debt grew by 8.6 percent in 2006, down from an 11.7 percent increase in 2005.</br></br>Subprime lender New Century Financial stopped accepting loan applications as it struggles to obtain financing despite market speculation that the company could file for bankruptcy protection. The lender faces investor lawsuits and an investigation by federal prosecutors into trading in its stock.</br></br>David Einhorn, the founder of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, resigned from its board. Einhorn's hedge fund holds a 6.3 percent stake in New Century, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</br></br>CVS boosted its offer for Caremark RX for a third time, a day after Express Scripts raised its bid. CVS increased the dividend it would pay Caremark shareholders by $1.50, bringing the total offer to $62.19 a share in cash and stock. It's the "best and final offer," CVS said in a statement.
The Pentagon and the State Department have been squabbling quite publicly over State's request to have the already-stretched military fill about 40 percent of the 300 new State jobs in Iraq created by the administration's latest rebuilding plan.</br></br>Seems the military isn't the only one balking at working there. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is finding it increasingly difficult to get local Iraqis to work there because of what one senior official at the embassy called the "precarious security situation" in the country.</br></br>Last year, 35 local employees resigned, "nearly all due to security issues," the official said. The State Department is authorized to hire 136 local people for jobs in the embassy, but right now only 47 are filled by Iraqis. Thirteen more are filled by Jordanians brought over in a program specifically set up to fill the chronic gap.</br></br>Even with the Jordanians, the "ever-growing" shortage of local Iraqis "seriously impacts on our ability to carry out the normal, day-to-day operations of the embassy," the official said. They can't find Iraqis to fill the solid-paying jobs even in a country where the unemployment rate is estimated to be 25 to 40 percent.</br></br>Two years ago, the department sent out pleas for volunteers to go to Iraq, but the responses were mostly from folks who could fill only low-level jobs. There are now a number of important mid-level jobs the embassy needs to fill with people from the region.
William J. McDonough, an executive at the First National Bank,of Chicago for most of his career and executive vice president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank since early last year, yesterday was named president of the New York bank, the most important of the Federal Reserve‰Ûªs 12 regional institutions.</br></br>McDonough, 59, was chosen by the New York Fed‰Ûªs board of directors with the approval of the Federal Reserve Board here. He will succeed E. Gerald Corrigan, who announced in January that he would resign effective Aug. 20.</br></br>EHen V. Futter, president of Barnard College and chairman of the New York Fed board of directors, said in a prepared statement that McDonough was chosen from among 50 candidates because of his "long and distinguished career in both the public and private sectors, together with his broad-based knowledge of the workings of financial institutions and financial markets, both nationally and internationally.‰Ûª‰Ûª</br></br>In a statement of his own, McDonough said the Fed‰Ûªs monetary policy should be focused "on achieving sustained economic growth. That requires prices stability, meaning low levels of inflation. How low? Low enough so that the fear of inflation does not distort in-</br></br>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and the other senior central bank officials who serve on the Federal Open Market Committee, the top monetary policy-making group, generally hold the same view about the goals for monetary policy.
The insider trading case against Paul Thayer is stunning evidence of what government regulators are up against in their drive to stop corporate executives from ripping off corporations and corrupting the stock market.</br></br>When Thayer resigned as deputy secretary of Defense 15 months ago, he denounced the charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission as ‰ÛÏutterly without merit‰Û and predicted that he would ‰ÛÏultimately be exonerated.‰Û</br></br>But as the facts unfold in three civil and criminal proceedings, the only problem with the original SEC complaint turns out to be that it did not go far enough in detailing Thayer‰Ûªs misdeeds. Rather than exoneration, Thayer is facing jail for obstruction of justice.</br></br>If he doesn‰Ûªt serve time, no one accused of insider trading should ever go to jail. Of course, almost no one goes to jail for insider trading now. It is the obstruction charge that could put Thayer behind bars, not his * multimillion-dollar white collar crime. Federal prosecutors are urging U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey to throw the book at Thayer for what may be Washington‰Ûªs worst coverup since Watergate.</br></br>Thayer lied to the FBI, the SEC and a grand jury, betrayed three corporations with which he was associated, made up phoney documents, urged his friends to help him cover his tracks and commit perjury, and used front men to hide his illegal investments, investigators said in recommending a prison sentence.
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson, who has held posts at the Treasury or the central bank for nine and a half years, resigned yesterday to accept an endowed teaching position at George Mason University in Fairfax.</br></br>Johnson said that he did not want to commit himself to a second four-year term as Fed vice chairman after his term expires Aug. 3. He could have continued as a Fed governor, without being vice chairman, until the year 2000. "This was the appropriate time to return to private life," he said.</br></br>The resignation caught most officials at the Fed and the White House by surprise. There was no suggestion yesterday of who the Bush administration might name to succeed him at the Fed, the institution that more than any other in U.S. government has been directing the course of the nation's economy.</br></br>That choice will be closely watched, however, since the White House has complained publicly upon occasion that the Fed is keeping interest rates too high.</br></br>As vice chairman of the Fed, Johnson generally has been a conciliatory force helping to bring a sometimes sharply divided board into agreement, but that was not the case when he was first named to the board by President Reagan in late 1985. At one of his first board meetings, he joined in an unusual and successful challenge to Paul A. Volcker, chairman at the time, to force a cut in interest rates.
When President Bush recently visited his summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., he lamented the devastation an Atlantic storm had wreaked on his property and his neighbors.</br></br>Had he returned four days later, he could have heard of the terrible damage wrought by the unrelenting recession that has struck the state he knows so well. "I see it every day," said one Mainer, "in the faces of friends and neighbors, whether it is the fear of a businessman who has never faced unemployment before, the mill worker resigned to the fate suffered by co-workers or the hopelessness of those who continue their fruitless search for a job."</br></br>This was not Bush's least-loved Mainer, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, speaking to some partisan Democratic crowd. It was Maine's Republican governor and loyal Bush supporter, John R. (Jock) McKernan Jr., explaining on Nov. 6 why he was proposing drastic cutbacks in government services - the layoff of one-fifth of state employees, a $50 million cut in aid to localities, elimination of the general assistance welfare program and abolition of 35 state agencies, including the Office of Volunteerism, which coordinates Maine's version of Bush's favorite "Thousand Points of Light" program.</br></br>All this in a desperate effort to close a budget shortfall that has emerged just since July, when McKernan furloughed all state employees for half the month in order to force through what he then hoped would be a solution.</br></br>The only consolation the governor could offer his beleaguered constituents is that similarly painful scenes are being enacted across the country from New England to California.
The long-running battle for control of the National Bank of Washington has generated an angry exchange of letters between the bank's chairman and D.C. Del. Walter F. Fauntroy, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, who opposes foreign ownership for the District's oldest bank.</br></br>In a Dec. 8 letter to the directors of the bank's holding company, Fauntroy threatened to press for hearings by the Federal Reserve Board should the bank be sold to foreign investors.</br></br>Credit "and other investment decisions which affect this community are being made in another community and, worse yet, another country," Fauntroy wrote.</br></br>But in a rejoinder dated Dec. 26, Luther H. Hodges Jr., chairman of Washington Bancorp., told Fauntroy that he was "shocked and dismayed by the tone of your letter," and criticized Fauntroy for interfering in the bank's affairs. He also reminded Fauntroy that NBW was already under the control of foreign investors, with Saudi investor Wafik Said controlling the largest block of stock.</br></br>Fauntroy's letter was described by congressional aides and banking executives as a highly unusual intervention on the part of a legislator. The exchange comes as officials are involved in 11th-hour negotiations over the sale of the bank to a number of interested bidders. Hodges has agreed to resign at the end of January if he fails to sell the bank or find a buyer for Said's shares by then.

The list goes on and on in what is shaping up to be quite a year for mergers, with deals involving U.S. targets up about 9% this year from last year, according to the Mergers & Acquisitions Report.</br></br>But here's something to keep in mind, especially if you're an investor in an acquiring company: Over time, based on postdeal stock prices, sellers often have proven to be smarter than buyers. That isn't to say there aren't smart buyers, including PepsiCo, which has effectively used acquisitions to diversify and grow. Or J.M. Smucker, the jelly company, which several years ago bought the Jif brand of peanut butter from Procter & Gamble. (Talk about synergy!)</br></br>But the reality is that "the seller always has better information," says Harbir Singh, professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</br></br>Seems obvious enough, but try telling that to investors in companies such as America Online after it swallowed Time Warner in a deal valued at more than $100 billion. Or Mattel, after its misguided $3.8 billion purchase of Learning Co. Or Quaker Oats, after its botched $1.7 billion acquisition of Snapple.</br></br>The difference between a good deal and a bad one often boils down to little more than hubris, or just plain ego, which can cause a buyer to overpay. "It's not that sellers are smarter than buyers," says Richard Roll, a finance professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management and author of "The Hubris Hypothesis of Corporate Takeovers." "It's just that buyers are overconfident in their ability to value what they're going to buy."
NEW YORK -- A portrait of the art market after this week would probably contain a greater share of somber hues.</br></br>Art dealers and art collectors across the country say the wild swings in the stock market may damp some of the euphoria that has characterized the art market in recent years. A number of dealers report that buyers who had paintings on hold or who had planned to purchase paintings are calling to postpone or cancel the deals. And some art experts expect the stratospheric prices that some works have commanded will return to more realistic levels -- just as the important fall auction season is beginning.</br></br>"I think the speculative fever (in art-buying) will subside now," says Lewis Manilow, a Chicago real-estate investor and major art collector. "This (stock market crash) is a dash of realism, and the art world needs some realism, too. It can't be endless."</br></br>Adds W. Graham Arader III, a print dealer who owns galleries in seven cities: "The art boom is over. It just got too high and it's over." Mr. Arader says he did a brisk business in August, especially to "Forbes 400 people," but that even before the crash, less-affluent collectors had stopped buying. "We did seven antique shows in the past three weeks, and we couldn't sell a thing," he says. "That has me scared."</br></br>No one expects the art market to collapse in a heap: There is no Dow Jones average that lumps together Louis XIV furniture and Picasso paintings. "Blue chip" art works have historically held their value much better than lower quality pieces in a downturn, and the Van Gogh iris painting set for sale at Sotheby's on Nov. 11 is still expected to fetch about $30 million, the second-highest price ever for a painting. Sotheby's is the auction house unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
Author: Conor Dougherty</br></br>A key gauge of U.S. inflation has fallen to its lowest level since record-keeping began in 1957, underscoring the continued weakness in the economy.</br></br>Consumer prices rose 0.2% in October compared with September, almost entirely because of higher energy costs, the Labor Department said Wednesday.</br></br>When volatile food and energy are subtracted, prices were unchanged last month--the third straight month in which this so-called core measure of inflation was flat. Compared with a year ago, consumer prices other than food and energy have risen 0.6%.</br></br>The drop in the core measure bolsters the Federal Reserve's case that inflation is so low--below its informal target--that it should resume its purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds to boost the economy.
NEW YORK -- Prices of Treasury bonds slumped yesterday as dealers and investors were shaken by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar's value against other major currencies.</br></br>Some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell more than half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the weekly auction of Treasury bills, but most other short-term rates rose.</br></br>Adding to investor jitters was a rise in the price of oil. Prices of gold and other precious metals viewed as harbingers of inflation also rose.</br></br>"Investors are growing increasingly concerned that the dollar's weakness could make foreigners reluctant to buy dollar-denominated securities," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. Foreign investors have purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds in recent years, helping the U.S. government finance its huge budget deficits.</br></br>Furthermore, a continued drop in the dollar might rekindle inflationary pressures and cause the Federal Reserve not to ease credit, some investment managers say. Analysts generally have been expecting the Fed to drive interest rates lower to try to to stimulate economic growth.
The once-dizzying rise in the value of privately owned Facebook Inc. has slowed, a sign the social network hasn't been immune to broader market volatility or the weakness in the global economy.</br></br>Despite the cooling, Facebook next year still is expected to make one of the largest U.S. initial public offerings ever. For now, its stock is traded on secondary marketplaces where wealthy investors and institutions can purchase shares offered mostly by former employees.</br></br>Facebook share prices surged 70% to $34 in March from December, as reported in auctions by SharesPost Inc., a trading platform for stocks of privately owned companies. The growth since has leveled off, with shares trading at $35 or below. Facebook's price has fallen 8% since July, to $32.10 in a SharesPost auction held last week, valuing the entire company at roughly $77 billion.</br></br>Facebook isn't alone, or even the worst hit of its bretheren. Hot technology companies that have gone public in recent years also took hits in the market-wide downturn. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has dropped 16% from its April peak, during which time the Nasdaq Stock Market Internet index has slid 21%.</br></br>Investors and analysts say the price of Facebook's stock, owned mostly by employees and outside investors, can't easily be pinned down because trades take place in a variety of venues, some of which don't disclose the prices. Also, valuations based on just a few buyers and sellers might not reflect how a company would be valued if millions of its shares were traded publicly.
The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to stay the course on its asset purchases surprised and confused many market participants, who felt the central bank had sent contradictory signals about its intentions. In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.</br></br>Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.</br></br>The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that "if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate." The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.</br></br>On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. "The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall," he said. "We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market."
The crosscurrents roiling the bond market intensified Thursday, as the gap between short- and long-term U.S. Treasury yields narrowed in the latest sign of uncertainty over the pace of U.S. growth.</br></br>Yields on short-term U.S. Treasury debt maturing in two to five years hit the highest level since 2011, reflecting an investor scramble to place bets on an expected Federal Reserve rate increase as soon as next spring. Yields rise when prices fall.</br></br>The selloff in short-term government debt extended a pullback that began following Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision to end its bond purchases later this year.</br></br>At the same time, yields on government debt maturing in 10 or more years have risen only modestly this week and remain well below their levels at the start of 2014, a year that many analysts forecast would include rising long-term interest rates and falling bond prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 8/32 lower, yielding 2.629%. That is the highest closing level since July 3 but compares with 3% at the end of 2013.</br></br>The softness of longer-term yields highlights concerns shared by many analysts and policy makers about the uneven growth of the U.S. economy and falling expectations for inflation. Investors broadly expect the Fed to raise the fed funds rate next year for the first time since 2006. But many analysts say that even a small uptick in rates could slow the economy and send already-low inflation further below the Fed's target.
Author: Luca Di Leo; Corey Boles</br></br>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended the central bank's plan to buy government bonds during a private gathering with U.S. senators, responding to several days of attacks from Republicans who say the Fed is causing inflation and weakening the dollar.</br></br>The Fed chairman denied the U.S. was manipulating the currency through its plan to purchase $600 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and pointed to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston which estimated the program could create 700,000 to one million jobs over two years.</br></br>Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, said he "wasn't persuaded" and noted that "even some Fed officials have doubts" about the central bank program.</br></br>Republican lawmakers said in a letter to Mr. Bernanke released Wednesday that the Fed's move "introduces significant uncertainty regarding the future strength of the dollar and could result...in hard-to-control, long-term inflation."
U.S. Treasury bonds pulled back after an early price gain, underscoring some uneasiness among traders and investors ahead of the Federal Reserve's next decision on its monetary stimulus for the economy.</br></br>The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to start a two-day monetary policy meeting Tuesday with an interest-rate statement due at about 2 p.m. EST Wednesday.</br></br>Market participants will zero in on whether the Fed will announce plans to dial back, or "taper," its bond purchases. The central bank's $85 billion-a-month purchases in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities have been a major factor holding Treasury yields near historic lows.</br></br>Traders, investors and analysts believe an improving economy would allow the Fed to start winding down its monetary stimulus. The Fed could act this week or wait until early January to cut bond buying, they said, though they believe the central bank would wind down its monetary stimulus on a gradual basis, which is likely to prevent a sharp rise in bond yields.</br></br>"We do think the odds of a December taper have gone up," said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc. "That said, the more likely time frame is early 2014, a view supported by the fact that inflation continues to remain low, allowing the Fed more latitude."
CHICAGO -- Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, called for the Fed to do more to charge up the economy, including a new program of U.S. Treasury bond purchases and possibly a declaration that it wants inflation to rise for a time beyond its informal 2% target.</br></br>"In the last several months I've stared at our unemployment forecast and come to the conclusion that it's just not coming down nearly as quickly as it should," Mr. Evans said Monday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. "This is a far grimmer forecast than we ought to have," he added. As result, he said, he favors "much more [monetary] accommodation than we've put in place."</br></br>The comments are significant because Mr. Evans tends to reflect the broad center of gravity at the central bank. His prescription for aggressive action, though not uniformly held by his colleagues, suggests a shift in the mood at the Fed.</br></br>On the heels of remarks by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley, it is likely to reinforce a growing conviction among investors that the Fed will restart a bond-buying program when it meets Nov. 2 and 3.</br></br>It also suggests Fed deliberations are going beyond resuming bond-buying plans to contemplating new strategies for inflation and for communicating the Fed's stance to the public.
Author: Gina Chon; Anupreeta Das</br></br>Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said 3i Group PLC was among those in talks over a possible purchase of Burger King Holdings Inc.</br></br>* * *</br></br>Burger King Holdings Inc. has been in talks with potential buyers in recent weeks about a possible sale of the second-largest hamburger chain, people familiar with the matter said.</br></br>The status of the talks is unclear but one interested firm was New York-based investment fund 3G Capital, these people said. It's uncertain whether these discussions will result in a sale.
For years, an obscure class of Wall Street investment vehicles has acted like a locomotive in the housing-finance business, driving growth by soaking up risky mortgage bonds and parceling them out to investors around the world.</br></br>Now, as mortgage problems mount and a wave of mortgage-bond downgrades looms, these investments, known as collateralized debt obligations, are starting to look like a different vehicle -- rockets overloaded with combustible fuel.</br></br>Some big investment banks have been wavering when launching new CDO deals because of problems in the subprime mortgage market, which caters to the least credit-worthy borrowers. The problems also have investors demanding much higher returns on the CDOs they buy, which makes them harder to sell and drives down their prices.</br></br>CDOs are an integral part of Wall Street's mortgage dicing-and- slicing machine. After mortgages are written, investment banks pool them together and use the cash flows they produce to pay off mortgage- backed bonds, which the investment banks underwrite.</br></br>The mortgage bonds, in turn, are often packaged again into CDOs and sold off in slices. Investors can choose to buy the risky pieces of the bonds or purchase slices with less risk.
The stock market in the third quarter slapped down investors who failed to heed this year's profit lesson: Buy stocks, not industry groups.</br></br>Just look at auto makers. Because the three stocks soared in the first half, many investors hopped on for a third-quarter jaunt. Instead, the group slammed into reverse. Autos finished dead last among 96 industries in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index, which rose 2.7% in the quarter.</br></br>But while General Motors slumped 27% and Ford slid 13.6%, Chrysler rose 9.5%.</br></br>The auto makers' third-quarter performances underscore some important trends that, analysts say, are expected to extend into the fourth quarter. First, stocks that are tied to the economic cycle, such as autos, generally fared worse than stocks that tend to maintain earnings in weak economic conditions. As investors grew increasingly disheartened about the pace of the U.S. recovery, they boosted their purchases of defensive stocks such as cosmetics and tobacco.</br></br>Second, though some sectors like autos performed poorly on the whole, individual stocks such as Chrysler proved resilient. Analysts say that in the current economic climate, careful stock selection is far wiser than sector-wide investing.
The House voted Thursday to make permanent a tax break allowing small businesses to write off up to $500,000 in new equipment purchases.</br></br>While the move adds to momentum for congressional efforts to extend a range of now-temporary tax breaks, it also sharpens a conflict between the House and Senate over whether to extend the breaks permanently or temporarily.</br></br>Thursday's vote was 272-144, with several dozen Democrats joining Republicans to support the measure.</br></br>The list of temporary tax breaks, many of which expired at the end of 2013, has grown over the years and now includes over 50 separate provisions affecting businesses as well as individuals.</br></br>By now, the cost of making them all permanent is proving to be prohibitive--almost $1 trillion over the next decade. But many of the breaks are so popular or important that lawmakers are reluctant to eliminate them.
INVESTORS ARE GOBBLING up retailing stocks in a manner that is in keeping with a season during which appetites often run unchecked. By Jan. 1, they may be staring into the mirror, wondering what led them to overdo it.</br></br>There is no question that the retail-sales outlook is better today than it was a month ago, when oil prices and the presidential election were significant worries. But most of the good news has been sopped up by the recent gains in retail stocks, meaning that any further holiday-season surge could be difficult to sustain.</br></br>First, the good news, of which there is plenty. The past several weeks have given retailers and their shareholders plenty of cause for cheer. Oil prices, which reached a high of $55.17 a barrel in New York on Oct. 22, closed at $47.32 Friday. The move lower suggests that in the months to come American households will be putting a little less cash into their gas tanks and furnaces than some feared, and more into stores' coffers.</br></br>Worries that the outcome of the presidential election would be hung up in courts for weeks, weighing on consumer confidence, proved unfounded. The stock market has been celebrating President Bush's re- election, and that may spur some people -- particularly the affluent, who account for an outsize portion of overall consumer spending -- to purchase a few more gifts this holiday season.</br></br>The October employment report showed far more hiring during the month than economists expected, and also included upward revisions for previous months. That means not only that there are more people with paychecks to spend but also that American workers in general may be a little less nervous about their jobs and thus a little more apt to make purchases. Indeed, sales look like they were more robust in October than expected. That puts spending on solid footing going into the holidays.
HONG KONG -- Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd., having lost a bid to have a lawsuit by Bear, Stearns & Co. dismissed, is hiring an additional New York law firm so its current legal counselors can participate in Jardine's defense as witnesses.</br></br>Bear Stearns filed the suit, which seeks unspecified damages for its shareholders, in a Manhattan U.S. district court last December after Jardine Strategic withdrew from an agreement to purchase a 20% stake in the big U.S. investment house for $390 million. Jardine Strategic scrapped the offer, which began on Oct. 6, 1987, shortly after the stock market crash.</br></br>A Jardine Strategic official in Hong Kong said the New York law firm of Curtis Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle has been retained because attorneys ordinarily can't appear as witnesses in cases they are litigating.</br></br>Debevoise & Plimpton, the law firm that handled the negotiations leading to the Bear Stearns agreement, will continue to work on the case in an advisory capacity, the official said.</br></br>Jardine Strategic is a 46%-owned affiliate of Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., which has interests in financial services, engineering and construction.
LONDON--Anheuser-Busch InBev NV lost momentum in its major markets, though price increases for its top lagers helped support profit in the first three months of 2013 for the world No. 1 brewer by sales.</br></br>InBev's total volumes, excluding acquisitions and disposals, fell 4.1% in the three months to March 31, compared with 1.8% growth in the same period last year, hurt by poor weather, higher fuel prices and tax rises, the company said. Total demand in North America fell 5%, from 1.2% growth last year--when falling unemployment among blue-collar U.S. workers helped U.S. beer sales rebound as the economy improved, growing for the first time since 2008. In North Latin America, including Brazil, volumes fell 5.8%, compared with 4.8% growth a year earlier.</br></br>The Leuven, Belgium-based maker of Budweiser generates three-quarters of its operating profit from the U.S. and Brazil. However, colder weather, higher gas prices and tax increases cut household spending and led to a drop in domestic U.S. beer shipments in the three months to Feb. 13, according to the Beer Institute, an industry body. InBev also warned in February of weaker trading in Brazil due to the earlier Carnival holiday period and the impact of price increases taken in the second half of last year, and last week rival Heineken NV warned of a slowdown in Brazil.</br></br>Inbev will extend its Americas business with the $20.1 billion purchase of Mexico's Grupo Modelo SAB in a deal that adds Corona Extra, the No. 1 imported brand in the U.S., to InBev's stable of beers in a deal expected to complete in June. It also allows InBev to push Budweiser brands south of the border, underscoring the importance of Mexico as one of several high-growth markets for InBev.</br></br>Net profit rose to $2.05 billion from $1.67 billion a year earlier, helped by hedging gains related to the Modelo deal. Revenue fell to $9.17 billion from $9.33 billion because of a weaker dollar even as InBev pushed through price increases. AB InBev's closely watched earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation fell to $3.43 billion from $3.56 billion.
Fannie Mae, the mortgage company behemoth, is not having a good year. Shareholder equity has been evaporating -- down 27% at the end of the third quarter (or down 47% if one ignores Fannie's accounting shenanigan). Worse, there are more difficulties on the way. Aside from skating on thin ice with investors, there is political risk from politicians who are looking at its operations with growing crankiness.</br></br>In the immediate post-Enron period, investors went on orange alert when increased scrutiny revealed that Fannie has serious problems with corporate governance, financial disclosure and reporting. More recently came revelations that Fannie was having trouble managing its huge portfolio of assets. A bad guess on the direction of interest rates exposed a giant mismatch between the maturities of its assets and liabilities, and demonstrated how vulnerable Fannie is to interest-rate risk.</br></br>The bizarre thing is that Fannie willingly (and happily) exposes itself to interest-rate risk. There is nothing in its government charter that even remotely requires Fannie to borrow great gobs of money to purchase and hold a huge portfolio of mortgages. Fannie does it because it is wildly profitable. Because of the implied government guarantee of its debt, Fannie can borrow at very low rates and then lend out that money at higher rates by retaining or repurchasing the mortgages it has securitized. This opportunity to borrow low and lend high is so seductive for profits, it's almost a form of entrapment.</br></br>It's such a good deal, in fact, that Fannie has issued an amazing amount of debt. Currently its outstanding debt is around $800 billion. Moreover, Fannie's debt relative to its small capital base gives it enormous leverage. Fan's required core capital is 2.4% of on-balance sheet assets and 0.45% of outstanding mortgage-backed securities and other off-balance sheet obligations. This is well below levels necessary for FDIC-insured commercial banks; even government securities dealers carry capital around 5% of assets. Fannie is running with this huge leverage (about 54-to-1) because it can -- shareholders, at least until this year, didn't seem to care.</br></br>What about its creditors? Well, considering taxpayers are the ultimate creditors, they should probably care more than they seem to. At the end of the third quarter, Fannie's combined debt and its mortgage-backed securities held by outside investors totaled $1.8 trillion.
TOKYO -- Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s agreement to purchase an 18% voting stake in PaineWebber Group Inc. marks an effort by the big Japanese insurance company to tap the high end of the financial business.</br></br>The $300 million accord, announced Monday, will give Yasuda access to the "financial high technology" that so many Japanese financial companies are obsessed with these days. "We need their technology," said Kyosaku Sorimachi, managing director of Yasuda. "We need to train our people through PaineWebber, to get their know-how." Mr. Sorimachi said that the accord allows Yasuda to send as many as 150 people through the PaineWebber organization for various kinds of instruction.</br></br>The Yasuda official said that "global asset management" is very high on the list of things PaineWebber can teach. Yasuda is the fifth-largest Japanese life insurer, with $22 billion in assets. About 17% of those assets are invested abroad, in bonds, stocks, real estate and loans to non-Japanese.</br></br>PaineWebber hopes, for its part, that the association with Yasuda will help the U.S. firm's presence in Tokyo. Yasuda is an old-line, well-connected and very large organization. Yasuda could introduce PaineWebber to potential clients, steer business its way and provide insight into the working of the Tokyo markets, especially the Tokyo stock market.</br></br>Yasuda is being somewhat coy about how helpful it will be to PaineWebber beyond supplying the firm with $300 million and putting two of its own people on PaineWebber's board. (Yasuda also agreed to purchase warrants that could eventually be converted to give the Japanese company 25% ownership of the U.S. firm.)
To the Red Sox winning the World Series, we can now add another miracle for the ages: A politician demanding tighter money. We refer to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who in a Berlin speech Tuesday rebuked the world's central bankers, notably including the U.S. Federal Reserve, for being too politically accommodating. Hallelujah, sister.</br></br>"The independence of the European Central Bank must be preserved and the things that other central banks are now doing must be retracted," Mrs. Merkel told a meeting sponsored by Germany's association of metal- and electrical-industry employers. "We must return together to an independent central-bank policy and to a policy of reason, otherwise we will be in exactly the same situation in 10 years' time." Referring to the U.S. central bank specifically, she said "I view with a great deal of skepticism the extent of the Fed's powers."</br></br>Usually when a politician lobbies a central bank, it's to demand easier money. We can't recall a similar tight-money intervention from a national leader, save perhaps Ronald Reagan's quiet support for Paul Volcker in the 1980s. Mrs. Merkel may have been channeling Ludwig Erhard, the great Chancellor whose hard-money policies helped to catapult the German economy from the ruins of World War II. Looking further back, she no doubt knows that the Weimer inflation of the 1920s paved the way for Hitler.</br></br>Whatever her inspiration, this is the second time Mrs. Merkel has volunteered to be the designated driver amid the G-20's fiscal and monetary binge. Three months ago, she led a revolt against President Obama's demand that Europe follow his Keynesian spending spree. Her spending restraint is already looking wise as the U.S. asks the world to finance a debt burden rising to World War II levels.</br></br>Now she's taking aim at monetary excess, even as the European Central Bank is being lobbied to pursue the same kind of "quantitative easing" that the U.S. Fed has carried out. The ECB is preparing to announce the details of its purchase of $85 billion in low-risk (mostly corporate) debt, and Ms. Merkel may have wanted to send a signal that it ought to stop there. She also rightly fingered "monetary policy in the United States" that was "politically supported" as a main cause of the current mess.
Trans World Airlines, in a restructuring effort, proposed to purchase its $1.2 billion in outstanding debt for cash, offering debtholders deeply discounted prices.</br></br>The move is an attempt to rid TWA of an expensive item -- interest expenses on the debt -- which has hamstrung the carrier since owner Carl Icahn took it private in 1988. The Mt. Kisco, N.Y., airline's highly leveraged position has grown more troublesome in recent months amid high jet fuel prices and the effects on air travel of the recession and the Mideast war. Since January, TWA has failed to meet interest and principal payments due on its debt.</br></br>In another indication of TWA's troubles, the carrier yesterday posted a first-quarter net loss of $88.2 million, compared with a year-ago net loss of $143 million. This year's loss was narrowed by the recent $110 million sale of TWA's Chicago-London route authority to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.</br></br>In the first quarter, TWA reported an operating loss of $144.4 million, wider than the year-earlier's $100.7 million operating loss. Revenue for the quarter fell 19% to $820.2 million from $1.01 billion a year-earlier.</br></br>In the debt-purchase offer, Mr. Icahn estimates he personally would lose "in excess" of $40 million on TWA debt he holds. Still, some debt specialists believe a successful restructuring could strengthen the airline and make it a much more valuable property for Mr. Icahn, who controls 90% of its stock.
DALLAS -- Carrington Laboratories Inc., citing the stock market's plunge, said it agreed to cancel a plan to receive a cash infusion from its newly appointed chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas J. Marquez.</br></br>Mr. Marquez, a former senior executive of Electronic Data Systems Inc., took the helm of the medical products maker in August after agreeing to purchase $5 million in unregistered common stock at half price or $15 a share, whichever is less. He agreed to increase his Carrington investment to $7.5 million by Nov. 30 under the same terms.</br></br>Mr. Marquez had so far purchased 266,667 shares for $4 million, giving him a 12.4% stake in the company.</br></br>At the time the agreement was reached, Carrington's stock was trading in the mid-$30 to high-$30 range. But Carrington has taken a beating since the stock market crash Oct. 19, plunging more than 50%. In national over-the-counter trading, Carrington closed yesterday at $17.25, down 25 cents.</br></br>Carrington said the stock market crash would force it to issue a number of shares under the agreement that would dilute other holders to an "unacceptable level." It also said Mr. Marquez was "no longer in a position" to purchase the additional shares. "We also feel that if, at some time in the future, it is necessary to raise additional capital, we should be able to do so on more favorable terms than those provided in the terminated agreement," said Clinton Howard, president and chief operating officer, in a statement.


TORONTO -- Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal posted increased net incomes for their fiscal second quarters as prudence helped them weather the recent economic slowdown and stock-market volatility.</br></br>Canadian banks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts as the economy has soured, partly because the Canadian companies had less exposure to deteriorating credit. "Canadian banks are relatively cautious," said Kevin Choquette, a Toronto analyst with Scotia Capital, the brokerage arm of Bank of Nova Scotia.</br></br>Credit problems for Canadian banks have also been milder because Canada emerged a year later than the U.S. from the last recession, Mr. Choquette added. That lag gave U.S. banks "an extra year to put on more marginal credit," he said.</br></br>For the quarter ended April 30, Royal Bank, based in Toronto, said net increased 4% to 602 million Canadian dollars (US$390.8 million), or 92 Canadian cents a fully diluted share, from C$578 million, or 89 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. Royal Bank's total provision for credit losses rose to C$210 million from C$172 million in the year-earlier period.</br></br>Results for the latest quarter included, for the first time, a full quarter of earnings for two recently acquired businesses: Dain Rauscher, a Minneapolis securities firm, and the insurance subsidiaries of South Carolina's Liberty Corp. While Dain Rauscher's results contributed to a 42% drop in Royal Bank's wealth-management earnings, the Liberty acquisitions' results fueled a 63% jump in insurance earnings. Personal- and commercial-banking earnings rose 26% to C$334 million.
The technology industry, an engine of innovation and U.S. prosperity for more than half a century, is accelerating its recovery from the recession with surging earnings that have spurred companies to sharply ramp up their hiring.</br></br>The latest evidence for the rebound came Thursday, when Internet giant Google Inc. posted a 37% profit jump for the first quarter and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a 34% revenue increase to record levels. The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp., which Tuesday announced quarterly profit that nearly quadrupled on a 44% jump in sales.</br></br>The trio of results kicks off what is likely to be a strong earnings streak as tech spending by companies and consumers picks up. Next week, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., among others, are slated to report quarterly results. Tech-research firm ISI Group projects that overall revenues from such companies will rise more than 10% for the first quarter, compared with a 16% decline a year earlier. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's forecasts a 79% increase in tech earnings for the quarter from year-ago levels.</br></br>The growth has reached a level where tech companies are pushing to hire again, in some cases engaging in heated competition for talent. That's a turnabout for the industry, which had a series of layoffs last year, when some tech giants, notably Microsoft Corp., had mass layoffs for the first time.</br></br>The hiring ramp-up began late last year, with demand for tech goods and services stabilizing after months of declines. At the time, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said the Mountain View, Calif., company was ready to spend again, including on new recruits. On Thursday, Google said it hired 786 new employees in the first quarter and was just getting started.
NEW YORK -- Warburg Pincus & Co. is a classic Wall Street "smart money" investor.</br></br>From 1971 to 1978, Warburg Pincus and its affiliated partnerships invested $15 million in Waste Management Co.; it cashed out in 1981 for $66 million. The low-profile partnership scored another coup in 1983, when it led a group that bought 45% of troubled toy-maker Mattel Inc. Since then, Warburg Pincus has quadrupled its money in Mattel.</br></br>"They're brilliant," says John Myers, an executive vice president at General Electric Co.'s pension fund, which invests with Warburg Pincus. Adds another investor, William Snow, treasurer of Johns Hopkins University: "They pick good companies, and they get very involved in management."</br></br>The only trouble is, Warburg Pincus's knack for smart investments may be waning. The firm still boasts an extraordinary long-term record: profits that average 25% a year since 1971. For most of the 1980s, though, its gains have slipped to about 18 1/2% a year after fees -- only slightly ahead of the stock market's performance, investors say.</br></br>Currently, Warburg Pincus is mired in a losing position in Community Newspapers Inc., a joint investment that it made with newspaper publisher Ralph Ingersoll in 1987. Last year -- when stock market averages jumped 31% -- Warburg Pincus's $1.1 billion 1986 fund posted only a 10% gain. Concedes Chairman Lionel Pincus: "It wasn't a great year for us."
WASHINGTON -- Strong machinery exports helped reduce the nation's merchandise trade deficit, measured on a balance of payments basis, to $35.95 billion in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>The level of exports and imports both set records, but exports expanded at a much faster rate. The fourth-quarter gap was revised to $41.19 billion; it was previously put at $40.17 billion.</br></br>Among exports, industrial supplies also posted a big increase in the first quarter. Farm shipments hit their highest mark since the fourth quarter of 1984, thanks partly to strong wheat shipments to the Soviet Union. Overall, exports increased 9.8% to $74.67 billion in the latest quarter from $68.01 billion in the previous period.</br></br>U.S. exports have benefited from the dollar's decline in foreign currency trading over the past three years. A lower dollar makes imports more expensive and U.S. products more competitive overseas.</br></br>Imports increased 1.3% to $110.62 billion from $109.21 billion. The figures benefited from an 11.6% drop in imports of petroleum and related products. The decline was due to lower prices, as shipments rose. Big increases came in nonelectrical machinery and passenger cars from Canada and South Korea. Auto imports from Japan and West Germany fell.
THE FINANCIAL markets could use a few good inflation watchers these days as soaring oil prices and a strong economy stoke concerns about rising consumer prices.</br></br>Among economists regularly surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, two have stood out for their ability to forecast inflation: Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, and Maria Fiorini Ramirez, of MFR Inc. Unfortunately, for those in need of guidance, the two economists now see things very differently. Ms. Fosler expects inflation to pick up by year's end while Ms. Ramirez sees inflation easing off a bit.</br></br>Collectively, the 56 economists in the Journal surveys have been expecting headline inflation to move down from the 3% rate posted early in the year, as prices for energy and other commodities ease. The consensus of the economists who participated in the latest monthly survey is that the consumer-price index will rise 2.5% on an annual basis by year's end. But that consensus is creeping up. The group was looking for a CPI increase of 2.3% two months ago.</br></br>Getting a fix on inflation and oil is becoming increasingly important. Higher consumer inflation could push up interest rates and erode the purchasing power of households, which could eventually derail economic growth. Right now the economy is sending off mixed signals on the outlook. While commodity prices have soared, manufacturers have had difficulty passing higher costs on to consumers.</br></br>Forecasts reflect the confusion. Among economists who have participated in the survey for at least three years, only nine accurately predicted the inflation rate would slow in 2003, when it dipped below 2%, and then accelerate again in 2004, when it shot up over 3%.
WASHINGTON -- The federal government opened its new fiscal year with a much bigger deficit than a year earlier, when it was operating on a reduced, temporary budget.</br></br>The total budget deficit widened last month to $40.26 billion from $22.58 billion a year earlier, when the government faced shutdowns and budgetary stalemates. The deficit is the amount by which expenditures exceed receipts.</br></br>In its monthly statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $99.95 billion in October, compared with $95.67 billion a year earlier and $157.67 billion in September. Outlays totaled $140.21 billion last month, compared with $118.25 billion a year earlier and $122.24 billion in September. The October budget gap compared with a revised surplus of $35.43 billion in September.</br></br>Separately, the Labor Department said the U.S. import price index, excluding fuels, fell 0.3% in October, marking the fifth monthly decrease for the index in the past six months. Import prices for nonpetroleum industrial supplies and materials, automotive vehicles, consumer goods and capital goods also posted modest declines in October. Only the index for foods, feed and beverages edged higher in the month, rising 0.1%.</br></br>Overall, import prices rose 0.4% in October, bolstered by a 6.1% jump in petroleum prices after a 7.4% gain in September. Over the last 12 months, prices for imported petroleum have risen 37.6%.
CARTERET, N.J. -- Pathmark Stores Inc. said it posted a profit before reorganization and other items for the fiscal fourth quarter of $13.6 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, mainly because of the opening of new stores and renovation of existing locations.</br></br>Including the reorganization and other items, the supermarket chain reported a net loss of $48.5 million, or $1.62 a share, for the period ended Feb. 3.</br></br>For a year earlier, Pathmark posted a loss of $2.5 million, or eight cents a share.</br></br>Results in the recent quarter are a combination of two different entities formed because of the company's emergence from Chapter 11 protection in September 2000.</br></br>Sales for the period climbed 11% to $1.06 billion from $956.1 million. Aside from an extra week in 2000, a company spokesman said the increase was driven by strong holiday sales, the opening of four new stores and renovation of 19 stores in the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas.
BANGALORE -- India's Hexaware Technologies Ltd. posted a 33% drop in its first-quarter consolidated net profit, but forecast robust revenue growth in the current quarter as it expects more outsourcing orders on a spike in technology spending by clients.</br></br>Hexaware joins bigger rivals Infosys Technologies Ltd. and Wipro Ltd. in projecting strong growth in coming quarters as a rebound in global technology spending helps India's software service exporters recover from the impact of the economic downturn.</br></br>"We have a strong (deal) pipeline. We expect to receive additional work from existing clients as they start on new projects," Chairman Atul Nishar told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.</br></br>The company's profit for the January-March period fell to 116 million rupees ($2.6 million) from 173 million rupees a year earlier. Consolidated revenue slipped 16% to 2.22 billion rupees from 2.64 billion rupees.</br></br>Analysts had mixed views on the results.
If you are planning to retire in the next few years, should you lighten up on your stock investments after a bad year in the market?</br></br>This is a key question for people who are hoping to retire soon but wondering how their nest eggs will hold up if stock prices fall still more or rise only feebly in the years ahead. After five glorious years of 20%-plus annual returns, the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year sank 9.1% including dividends, its worst year since 1977. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 6.2%. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market posted its steepest dive in history, shedding 39% while some Internet stocks fell much harder.</br></br>The answer is that there is no single answer: No cookie-cutter solution fits all. It may well be time for people nearing retirement to cut back on stocks, but it wouldn't be smart to do it in one fell swoop. The right move for you depends on several factors, notably your age, your life expectancy and -- this is key -- whether you have enough cash on hand to avoid dumping stocks at low prices if you encounter more bad stock-market years immediately after you retire.</br></br>To provide some guidance, Encore talked with a number of financial advisers who specialize in retirement. Here's what we found:</br></br>The Lessons of History
Author: Min Zeng</br></br>NEW YORK--A better-than-forecast jobs report eased fears about a double-dip recession in the U.S. and fueling broad selling in Treasurys and government bonds in Germany and the U.K.</br></br>The Treasurys market lost ground for a third straight session, and the benchmark 10-year note posted a second consecutive weekly loss.</br></br>At the peak of the selling, the 10-year Treasury note's yield, which moves inversely to the price, touched 2.770%, the highest since Aug. 10. The yield has risen about 0.30 percentage point since hitting a 19-month low of 2.418% on Aug. 25.</br></br>"Investors across asset classes had soured enormously on the economy and were leaning on one side of the boat and were thus caught by surprise by stronger data," said Tony Crescenzi, portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif. "The pain trade is higher in yields."
WASHINGTON -- Industrial production fell in December for the third consecutive month, offering bleak news on the state of America's smokestack economy.</br></br>The 0.2% drop last month followed declines of 0.2% in November and 0.1% in October, the Federal Reserve Board said. A string of strong growth numbers last spring and early summer had seemed to indicate that the industrial sector was recovering, but the more recent figures from the Federal Reserve cast doubt on that.</br></br>"This is not a free fall," said Stuart Hoffman, senior economist for PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh, referring to a term President Bush used last week in New Hampshire to describe the economy. "But industrial production was a source of strength for the economy last spring, and now it is a source of weakness."</br></br>Most of the decline in industrial production last month stemmed from a 3% drop in output of utilities; unusually warm weather reduced demand for electricity. Factories posted an 0.1% gain in output after declining 0.3% the month before. The auto industry, struggling to cope with excess inventories, cut output of cars and trucks 2.3%.</br></br>Mr. Hoffman predicted that autos will continue to be a source of problems in the first quarter and will drag industrial production figures down.
A sudden surge in U.S. interest rates has dimmed the luster of some of the bond world's brightest stars.</br></br>Bill Gross, Dan Fuss, Jeffrey Gundlach and Michael Hasenstab were among portfolio managers whose funds posted losses during the second quarter.</br></br>The tumble in Treasury prices led to the biggest-ever quarterly loss for Mr. Gross's $268 billion Pimco Total Return fund. Investors in the fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., a unit of Allianz SE of Germany, have lost more money than holders of the average bond fund this year, a rare setback for a manager who has consistently beaten the market over more than two decades. Of the four large bond funds, Pimco Total Return was the only one to trail its benchmark in the second quarter and full year.</br></br>The culprit: a rapid rise in Treasury yields that started in May amid fears the Federal Reserve would pull back its stimulus. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen about a percentage point since early May. On Thursday, the yield fell to 2.576%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>The reversal was particularly brutal for holders of emerging-market bonds and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which compensate investors for rising inflation. Neither bet panned out as funds rushed out of poorer-country markets and U.S. inflation softened. Mr. Gross allocated 18% in the two asset classes in the bond fund at the end of May, according to Pimco.
GREENSPAN SUGGESTED that progress against inflation may be drawing to a close, but stopped short of saying policy makers will have to raise interest rates. The Fed chairman said 1996 so far "has been a good year" for the economy, but that it would begin to slow down in the second half. He said the Fed will be in a state of "heightened surveillance" for signs of higher inflation in weeks ahead.</br></br>Stocks and bonds rallied on his testimony. The benchmark bond's price rose nearly 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield back below 7%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 87.30 to 5464.18, and the Nasdaq gained 23.17 to 1109.82.</br></br>---</br></br>AT&T showed significantly lower calling volume and revenue growth in the second quarter, though its overall net income rose by 10%. The company's shares fell 4% to $54.125.</br></br>Lucent posted strong quarterly revenue growth, but profit was cut by the high cost of splitting from AT&T.
WASHINGTON -- The federal government posted a budget deficit of $44.3 billion in February, wider than the $38.36 billion in red ink a year earlier, the Treasury Department said.</br></br>But the first five months of fiscal 1996 looked a bit better, with the deficit shrinking to $80.8 billion from $96.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. The Clinton administration, often boasting that its programs have reduced the deficit, has forecast that the fiscal 1996 deficit will total $158 billion, down from $164 billion in the previous year, and that the country will show a surplus in 2002.</br></br>February's budget gap compared with a surplus of $19.27 billion in January. The government often shows a surplus in December and January, in line with tax payment cycles.</br></br>In its statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $89.35 billion last month, compared with $82.54 billion a year earlier and $142.92 billion in January. Outlays totaled $133.64 billion last month, compared with $120.90 billion a year earlier and $123.65 billion in January.</br></br>---
General Electric Co. reported signs of a slow global economic recovery, even as it posted a 42% third-quarter earnings decline driven by lower-than-expected revenue and more write-downs at its finance unit.</br></br>"The global environment has definitely improved," Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors. "We are expecting a gradual recovery."</br></br>GE, of Fairfield, Conn., posted net income of $2.49 billion, or 23 cents a share, down from $4.31 billion, or 43 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 20% to $37.8 billion from $47.2 billion, on declining orders for industrial equipment and the ongoing shrinkage of the finance unit, known as GE Capital.</br></br>Earnings at GE Capital fell 87% to $263 million amid rising delinquencies and write-downs at its consumer, business-loan and commercial-real-estate units. A tax benefit helped the results.</br></br>The real-estate group swung to a $538 million loss from a $244 million profit a year ago. Delinquencies in the $84 billion real-estate portfolio rose to 4.19%, from 0.19% a year ago. GE said delinquency rates in its consumer-loan portfolio appeared to have "leveled off" in the third quarter at 4.78%, up from 2.74% a year ago.
Shares of Media Vision Technology Inc., a once-highflying maker of video and sound accessories for computers, fell 48.8% after the company said it expects to post a "substantial loss" for the first quarter.</br></br>The loss will stem partly from reducing prices on certain of its retail products in response to aggressive price-cutting by the competition.</br></br>The Fremont, Calif., company also said shipment of one of its new multimedia products would be delayed into the second quarter, resulting in a significant drop in revenue for the first quarter.</br></br>The company would not comment beyond a terse news release, which provided no details on which products were involved in the price cuts or shipment delay. Paul Jain, president and chief executive officer, was not available for comment.</br></br>The slide to $11 a share, down $10.50 Nasdaq Stock Market trading, came after Media Vision shares had already tumbled precipitously in recent weeks, following the release of fourth-quarter results showing a growing backlog of unsold products. The one-time Wall Street darling had seen its share value rocket to a December high of $43.75 from $20.25 when it first went public in 1992. From its zenith, Media Vision has lost about $500 million in market capitalization.
Investors seeking income growth with less risk than that posed by the broad stock market have long bought shares of companies that regularly boost dividends.</br></br>But amid the financial crisis of the past year, the strategy -- and, along with it, dividend-focused mutual funds -- took a big hit as banks and other once-reliable sources of dividends slashed payouts to conserve cash. The shares of these companies also plummeted, making it one of the worst periods in memory for dividend-oriented funds.</br></br>Many such funds posted returns of minus 25% or worse for 2008. Although that wasn't quite as bad as last year's almost 40% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the poor performance of such funds stunned shareholders who thought they had chosen a fairly conservative investment approach.</br></br>Many of those investors are now looking for income and greater principal stability in places such as the bond market, while some advisers are steering clients toward different stock strategies.</br></br>But if you are thinking about throwing in the towel on dividends and dividend-focused funds, there may be reasons to reconsider.
Charles Schwab Corp.'s second-quarter earnings missed analysts' estimates as the discount brokerage's expenses climbed 8.7% from a year earlier amid higher compensation and technology costs.</br></br>The San Francisco company posted net income of $256 million, or 18 cents a share, down from $275 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago. The year-earlier period included a benefit of $70 million, or roughly two cents a share, related to the resolution of a vendor dispute.</br></br>The results put pressure on Schwab's stock, which has rallied this year. The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares fell 3.3% to $21 in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday but remain up 46% so far in 2013.</br></br>While Schwab's earnings excluding the earlier gain rose 11%, investors focused on the per-share figure, which was a penny below Wall Street's average forecast of 19 cents. The shortfall came as Schwab missed its own forecast for curbing some quarterly expenses, such as employee pay. The company's expenses are still tracking above a new target it issued for such costs for 2013.</br></br>In March, Schwab backed away from a planned spending push it outlined at the beginning of the year because trading volumes didn't rebound as the company had expected after the U.S. presidential election.
LOS ANGELES -- Over the past three years, Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. has worked hard to develop a marketing-driven approach to home building that it says will insulate it from the industry's notorious cycles.</br></br>But investors, so far, aren't convinced.</br></br>The big home builder last month posted its 17th consecutive quarterly earnings report that topped or matched analysts' expectations. Yet its stock sells for just seven times earnings that are expected to increase by 52% to $145 million, or $3.02 a diluted share, for the fiscal year ending next month. The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $17.8125, up 6.25 cents and near a 52week low.</br></br>Industry-wide, earnings multiples "are exceptionally low by historical standards," Merrill Lynch analyst Robert F. Curran says, "probably among the lowest ever." The reason: fears that another interest-rate increase is imminent, in a year when rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have already risen nearly a percentage point. Wall Street also frets about spot labor shortages and increasing land and construction-materials costs.</br></br>Bruce Karatz, Kaufman & Broad's chief executive, finds this sentiment exasperating. "The market is saying 'the end is near,' and clearly doesn't give Kaufman & Broad Homes credit for changing its business model and mitigating cyclical risk," he complains.
Author: Isabel Ordonez</br></br>HOUSTON--Exxon Mobil Corp. said Thursday its first-quarter earnings surged 69% as it benefited from high oil prices, stronger refining margins and a jump in natural-gas production. Other oil companies also reported soaring profits.</br></br>The results for Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reflected a continued recovery from the recession for the broader energy sector, which appears poised for a return toward the boom that preceded the 2008 financial collapse. But the robust earnings also coincide with sharp increases in gasoline prices, which have triggered concern among consumers and elected officials.</br></br>Exxon's earnings jumped to $10.65 billion, or $2.14 a share, from $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share, beating analysts expectations of $2.06 a share. The results were $4 billion shy of the record $14.8 billion it generated in the third quarter of 2008. Revenue rose 26% to $114 billion.</br></br>Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. said profit jumped 46% to $1.55 billion, and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC posted profit of $6.29 billion, up 30%.
THE DOW JONES Industrial Average bypassed its high within minutes of the market open, then again near the close, but trimmed its gains to finish shy of the record.</br></br>The indicator, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies, posted an intraday high of 11728.46, up 5.48 points from its January 2000 peak. But on the day, the Dow industrials finished up 29.21 points, or 0.29%, at 11718.45, up 9.3% on the year.</br></br>Among the Dow average's strongest components were Caterpillar and General Motors. GM rose after Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda, which owns 9.9% of GM's shares outstanding, said it was considering purchasing as many as 12 million more shares of the auto maker. Tracinda also said it supports an alliance between GM and Renault-Nissan.</br></br>However, the three names with the biggest influence weightings in the price-weighted Dow industrial average -- International Business Machines, Altria Group and Boeing -- all finished the day off less than 0.5%. Even modest gains at one or two of those companies would have sent the Dow industrial average over its record, which now stands just 4.53 points away, at 11722.98.</br></br>"The Dow is teasing everybody right now," said Kenneth Tower, chief market strategist at the online-brokerage firm CyberTrader.
Trip Hawkins, the charismatic chairman of 3DO Co., may be forced to dig deep into his own pockets to help keep his video-game player afloat for the next year, as a key partner and several game suppliers appear to be backing away.</br></br>3DO is trying to break into the major leagues as the video-game industry, ruled by Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Nintendo Co., shifts to a more powerful breed of game machines. Some big names are backing 3DO's ambition, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Corp. The company says it has recruited 550 outside game developers and pressed over one million copies of 50 titles on compact disks that hold computer data. It also asserts it got off to a "strong start" in Japan, selling 80,000 machines in the first two months.</br></br>But despite a blizzard of publicity generated in part by Mr. Hawkins's marketing skills, the company has been hampered by surprisingly slow initial sales in the U.S. where demanding kid consumers say the games don't offer enough pizazz for the $500 price. Only 40,000 units of its game player, sold under Matsushita's Panasonic label, have been sold since October despite a price cut from an original $700. "Everyone has been shocked at the lower sales," says a person close to the company. Now, after posting a $51.4 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 3DO has about two quarters of cash left amid mounting expenses, such as a national advertising campaign and a shift to in-house game development.</br></br>Mr. Hawkins, who is also chairman of video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc., has sold nearly $15 million in Electronic Arts stock since November. A person familiar with his plans says he intends to put $10 million into 3DO and raise $10 million from GoldStar Co., a Korean conglomerate, and an additional $10 million from current partners in a private placement of stock by the end of June. The company had attempted to raise money through a secondary offering last December, but its sagging stock price thwarted the plan. Having peaked at $47 in October, the stock closed unchanged at $15.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.</br></br>"I enjoy putting my money where my mouth is," Mr. Hawkins says, but declines to discuss specific plans for his money or identify any next-round investors. As for 3DO's cash squeeze, he says, "It's a moot point . . . There is plenty of money that wants to be invested in the company."
Zions Bancorp. said its first-quarter earnings fell 8.6% as the regional lender continued to slash its exposure to complex investments that hindered the firm's stress-test results with the Federal Reserve.</br></br>The Salt Lake City-based bank posted a profit of $101.2 million, down from a year-earlier profit of $110.7 million. On a per-share basis, which reflects the payment of preferred dividends, earnings were 41 cents, down from 48 cents a year earlier.</br></br>Revenue rose 2.9% to $554.8 million.</br></br>Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of 42 cents a share and revenue of $543.7 million.</br></br>While the banking industry has struggled to boost revenue in the face of low interest rates and muted economic recovery, several regional lenders have reported an uptick in borrowing, especially among business clients, in recent days.
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. recorded a $14.17 billion merchandise trade deficit last month, as exports rose but oil imports surged for the second month in a row, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>The gap followed a revised May deficit of $13.12 billion. Because there is a delay in reporting import figures, however, Commerce Department statisticians caution against comparing revised figures from one month with preliminary ones from another. The May deficit had been reported as $14.21 billion.</br></br>For the second consecutive month, the U.S. posted a deficit in agricultural trade, the first such back-to-back deficits since the 1950s, according to an Agriculture Department historian. June's $71.2 million gap followed May's $348.7 million gap.</br></br>Also, the deficit in manufactured goods swelled in June as exports increased but imports did, too. This underscores the drag that imports exerted on economic growth in the second quarter.</br></br>"Demand by U.S. consumers is fairly strong but much of that demand is leaking abroad," said David Berson, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. He called the 9.4% growth in exports last month a "silver lining" in the report, but he predicted that the trade balance wouldn't improve significantly until next year.
NEW YORK -- Mutual-fund managers can rejoice. For only the second time in the past 12 months, actively managed stock funds finished the month ahead of funds pegged to one of the market's most widely followed indexes.</br></br>After trailing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for most of the past year, actively managed funds weathered the recent tumult in the stock market better than index funds. And they did it largely by benefiting from many of the same factors that have hindered them in the past year.</br></br>It may not be much to brag about, however, because actively managed funds actually just posted smaller losses than index funds. According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., domestic equity funds, excluding S&P 500 funds, posted an average loss of 1.65% between the end of July and Aug. 28. Index funds lost 5.19% on average. The S&P, meanwhile, dropped 5.17%.</br></br>Gus Sauter, managing director at index-fund proponent Vanguard Group, acknowledges that the climate has changed in the stock market. "The environment we've experienced over the last couple of months has made it a little easier for the active manager when compared to the S&P," says Mr. Sauter, who heads the index-fund group at Vanguard. "It's not that it's a terrible story for the S&P, it's more that it's moved down to the middle of the pack."</br></br>Using S&P 500 funds as a benchmark, "passive funds have been one of the poorer investments over the past four weeks, instead of one of the better ones, as they had been for quite some time," says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Inc.


When President Obama needed a business executive to come to his campaign defense, Jim Sinegal was there. The Costco co-founder, director and former CEO even made a prime-time speech at the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte. So what a surprise this week to see that Mr. Sinegal and the rest of the Costco board voted to give themselves a special dividend to avoid Mr. Obama's looming tax increase. Is this what the President means by "tax fairness"?</br></br>Specifically, the giant retailer announced Wednesday that the company will pay a special dividend of $7 a share this month. That's a $3 billion Christmas gift for shareholders that will let them be taxed at the current dividend rate of 15%, rather than next year's rate of up to 43.4% -- an increase to 39.6% as the Bush-era rates expire plus another 3.8% from the new ObamaCare surcharge.</br></br>More striking is that Costco also announced that it will borrow $3.5 billion to finance the special payout. Dividends are typically paid out of earnings, either current or accumulated. But so eager are the Costco executives to get out ahead of the tax man that they're taking on debt to do so.</br></br>Shareholders were happy as they bid up shares by more than 5% in two days. But the rating agencies were less thrilled, as Fitch downgraded Costco's credit to A+ from AA-. Standard & Poor's had been watching the company for a potential upgrade but pulled the watch on the borrowing news.</br></br>We think companies can do what they want with their cash, but it's certainly rare to see a public corporation weaken its balance sheet not for investment in the future but to make a one-time equity payout. It's a good illustration of the way that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's near-zero interest rates are combining with federal tax policy to distort business decisions.
Tokyo stocks racked up a 1.3% gain Wednesday, bolstered by a stronger U.S. dollar against the yen and more indications that the Japanese government will support ailing banks. The London market ended mixed, its early gains erased by a sharp drop in British unemployment. Frankfurt equities jumped to their eighth consecutive record. Amsterdam, Mexico City and Sydney shares all extended their record-setting streaks.</br></br>World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index was at 150.35, up 1.33, reflecting higher markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific and declines in Europe/Africa.</br></br>Semiconductor stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, closing at 555.53, up 22.37, or 4.20%, with Applied Materials of the U.S. posting a 15.51% gain. Trucking stocks trailed at 82.39, down 1.08, or 1.29%, with Arnold Industries of the U.S. sliding 9.84%.</br></br>In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index climbed 228.79 points to 18409.96, after advancing 314.13 points Monday; the market was closed Tuesday for a national holiday. On Thursday, the Nikkei surged 343.18 points to close the morning session at 18753.14. Wednesday's first-section volume was estimated at 457 million shares, up from 340.5 million shares on Monday. Losers narrowly topped gainers, 552-523. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first-section issues gained 13.54 points, or 1%, to 1368.43.</br></br>The head of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party said the government was prepared to use tax funds to help commercial banks in an emergency; this followed the finance minister's Monday remarks, also suggesting government support for the banks. Positive sentiment prompted buying to cut losses in short sales of stock that had been borrowed in hopes of a price drop that would allow its replacement at a profit. With the dollar up against the yen in Tokyo, Japanese public pension funds bought export-oriented real estate issues, which soared 2.1%, while foreign investors snapped up high-technology blue chips; the electronics sector zipped up 1.9%.
NEW YORK -- Interest rates are likely to push higher even when the long-awaited slowdown in the economy finally appears, according to many bankers and economists.</br></br>The Federal Reserve System will keep a tight grip on credit in coming months to underscore its determination to hold the line on inflation, these analysts said. Furthermore, they said, businesses will borrow heavily to finance new equipment and the construction of new plants.</br></br>"We can't see a fundamental turn in interest rates without an abatement in the explosion" of business borrowing, said Wayne Lyski, a vice president of Alliance Capital Management Co., an investment manager. And that isn't likely, he contended. "The single biggest negative in the bond market continues to be an escalation in credit demands."</br></br>Many investors have been hoping that slower economic growth will lead to less borrowing and lower interest rates. But those hopes are misplaced, argued Edward Yardeni, senior vice president and economist of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</br></br>"History shows that slower economic growth is associated with rising credit demands, not falling credit demands," Mr. Yardeni said. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds, currently at about 12 3/4%, are likely to surge to 14% by January, he predicted.
NEW YORK --- Corporations rushed a record amount of new notes and bonds to the market yesterday to take advantage of the lowest long-term interest rates in two decades.</br></br>Companies ranging from steelmaker Weirton Steel Corp. and telecommunications company Pacific Bell, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, to wood products, gypsum and chemicals concern Georgia-Pacific Corp. issued $5.81 billion of new debt, a one-day record, according to Securities Data Co. The previous record was set Jan. 8, 1992, when $5.25 billion of debt was offered. So far this week, companies have borrowed $12.97 billion, just under the one-week record of $13.3 billion raised in the week ended Jan. 11, 1992.</br></br>The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond remained unchanged yesterday at 6.88% as its price dropped very slightly to 102 29/32. Before last week, the bond yield had never dipped below 7.10% since the Treasury began regular 30-year bond auctions in 1977. The price of 10-year notes dropped 1/8 point to 101 17/32 to yield 6.03%, up from 6.01% on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year note has hovered at 20-year lows for the past four trading sessions.</br></br>While interest in the corporate notes and bonds seemed strong, said underwriters, demand was not nearly as strong as in January, when corporations issued more than $37 billion of new notes and bonds.</br></br>Some underwriters worried that yesterday's flood of new issuance could quell the strong investor demand for new corporate bonds in evidence so far this year.
LONDON -- No matter where you look in Europe, telecommunications companies are struggling to raise money.</br></br>Investors have all but turned their backs on the sector, and the Dow Jones Stoxx telecommunications index has plunged 32% this year. The latest victim is Telenor of Norway, which was forced to slash the price range on the final day of order-taking for its high-profile initial public offering.</br></br>European telecommunications and technology shares bounced back Friday, though most major markets closed only moderately higher. Asian stocks rallied, showing little effect from the sharp fall in Nasdaq overnight. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.92%, or 1.91, to 208.68. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 1.5%, or 2.29, to 155.28.</br></br>Young European telecommunications companies have been shut out of the high-yield bond market for months, and yields in Goldman Sachs' sub-investment-grade Euro Telecom bond index have doubled from their lows of the year to 20.26% on Thursday. Only blue-chip stalwarts can still raise cash using their investment-grade ranking, though even they must offer higher yields to attract buyers. British Telecommunications, for example, had to increase the yield for its $6 billion to $8 billion global bond offering, which is expected to be priced today.</br></br>Now, the loan market is starting to freeze up, according to some bankers. Syndicated loans typically have been the most stable source of funding for companies, and telecommunications concerns have borrowed a record $216.4 billion this year, according to Capital DATA Bondware.
Institutional money managers are targeting the hedge-fund business as a fee-rich growth area that can also help retain promising talent.</br></br>Leading the pack: Alliance Capital Management LP, the money-management company whose family of hedge funds already has $1.3 billion under management -- and is gunning for $2 billion by year end.</br></br>Hedge funds are private investment partnerships for qualified wealthy investors that often use borrowed funds to boost returns from bets on stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. Because hedge funds aren't subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, they offer the individual investor some investment choices he or she can't get in mutual funds, namely the option to profit from stock-market declines by selling borrowed shares short.</br></br>For investment companies, though, hedge funds present the constant threat that carefully groomed talent will be drained away. The lure: hedge funds' usual annual charge of 1% on assets under management, plus a 20% cut of gains for the top dog (whether performance tops the benchmarks or not). In recent years, a weed patch of fresh hedge funds has sprouted as a result: One estimate puts total assets in such funds at $370 billion, in 3,000 funds.</br></br>"This raises the question of who will manage the big money in the future," wrote Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, in a report published this week that cited those estimates.
While the deficits caused by the fiscal stimulus package will end in 2011 and will help to sustain a fragile recovery in 2010, the deficits projected for the longer term are a threat to our economic future. The starting point for controlling those future deficits is for Congress to abandon the administration's health-care plan -- a plan that will cost more than $1 trillion.</br></br>The deficits projected for the next decade and beyond are unprecedented. According to an assessment released in March by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the president's budget implies that deficits will average 5.2% of GDP over the next decade and will be 5.5% of GDP in 2019. Without the president's proposals, the budget office forecasts a 2019 deficit of only 2% of GDP.</br></br>The CBO's deficit projections are based on the optimistic assumptions that the economy will grow at a healthy 3% pace with no recessions during the next decade; that there will be no new spending programs after this year's budget; and that the rising national debt will increase the rate of interest on government bonds by less than 1%. More realistic assumptions would imply a 2019 deficit of more than 8% of GDP and a government debt of more than 100% of GDP.</br></br>Such enormous deficits would crowd out productivity-enhancing investments in new equipment and software as the government borrows funds otherwise available to private investors. The result would be slower economic growth and a lower standard of living.</br></br>In the nearer term, the projected deficits could cause interest rates on bonds and mortgages to rise sharply if bond investors fear that the government will not prevent inflation. This is a greater risk now that more than half of the U.S. government debt is held by the Chinese and other foreign investors. Such an interest rate rise could kill a recovery in 2010 or 2011 and depress growth in the years that follow.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>For global investors, some of the most popular trades are getting a bit harder to carry.</br></br>The carry trade -- broadly defined as borrowing money in currencies with lower interest rates and reinvesting where rates are more favorable -- had been hugely popular last year.</br></br>In the second half of 2004, a falling dollar and comparatively low U.S. interest rates made the dollar an ideal currency to borrow, or fund, the trade. Many investors were also fond of the yen and the Swiss franc, since interest rates in Switzerland and Japan were so low. At the same time, they were investing the money and getting high returns on bonds in countries like the United Kingdom, Australia and in emerging markets.</br></br>More recently, a long list of factors have been unraveling the attractiveness of such trades. Among them have been the durability of the early-2005 dollar rally, rising U.S. interest rates, a more shaky outlook for the Australian dollar, traction in the Japanese economic recovery and the potential revaluation of the yuan by China.
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Some of Brazil's biggest companies have postponed plans to borrow on international debt markets, as lending terms stiffen and foreign investors back off.</br></br>Several large electric utilities have postponed dollar-denominated debt issues, and firms including cellular and media concerns are looking to local markets and bank loans to finance their operations and repay maturing debt.</br></br>"A new [international] issue just won't happen right now," says Robert Nydegger, a Latin America corporate credit analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. "The cost of debt is just way too expensive."</br></br>The interest rate on Brazilian corporate bonds has jumped by about two percentage points over the past two months, raising bond yields for some blue-chip companies to nearly 16%. The recent half-percentage-point rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve was the breaking point for some companies, whose foreign borrowing rates are priced according to U.S. Treasury bonds.</br></br>Fresh from a four-city roadshow in the U.S. and Europe, electric utility Light Servicios de Eletricidade SA last week postponed a $150 million bond sale following the Fed move. A person familiar with the issue, who says Light was also following the whipsaw movements of the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, says investors who had tentatively agreed to accept a rate of 9.75% were suddenly demanding payments as high as 11%.
Baseball players are said to peak in their late 20s. Chess players in their mid-30s. Theoretical economists in their mid-40s.</br></br>But in ordinary life, there's an obvious tension between sheer smarts, often seen in the supple minds of the young -- and experience, which comes only with age.</br></br>Which one is more valuable in making personal-finance decisions?</br></br>A quartet of economists think they have found an answer. In looking at which consumers get stuck paying those pesky credit-card fees, the economists noticed a puzzling pattern: Younger and older consumers were more likely than others to get hit with easily avoided fees. So the economists expanded their inquiry to loans and other products, and sifted through records of tens of thousands of consumers.</br></br>They found that middle-aged adults tend to borrow at lower interest rates and pay fewer fees than younger and older adults. The age at which consumers are least likely to make financial mistakes: a few months past their 53rd birthday, despite all the pressures that accompany middle age.
With this fiscal year's budget deficit expected to more than double from the previous year, the U.S. government plans to nearly quadruple its borrowing to $555 billion.</br></br>The increase reflects lower tax receipts due to the ailing economy, higher outlays from the economic-stimulus package, as well as large redemptions by the Federal Reserve in connection with its liquidity initiatives.</br></br>This week, the Treasury estimated it will borrow $171 billion in marketable debt in the July-September quarter, $59 billion more than it previously projected and the second-highest borrowing figure on record. The highest was $244 billion in January-March 2008. It borrowed $13 billion of marketable debt in the second quarter.</br></br>"The increase in borrowing is primarily due to higher outlays and lower net issuances of state and local government-series securities," the Treasury said in a statement accompanying its borrowing-needs estimate.</br></br>The latest projection for this quarter would leave the Treasury with an estimated cash balance of $45 billion Sept. 30.
The economic damage from Hurricane Katrina will take months to sort out, but it's not too soon to sort the good from the bad among possible government responses. The first rule of policy in a disaster should be to do no more harm.</br></br>In the category of good is the Bush Administration's decision yesterday to release some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help Gulf Coast refiners keep operating. With oil supplies reduced, the refiners need to borrow the SPR crude or they might have to shut down. The companies will return the borrowed oil to the Reserve when private supplies are back to normal.</br></br>The Administration is also right to resist the temptation to go further and flood the market with Reserve crude, even if that would look good politically. "The President is willing to do what it takes to relieve an oil company, but not enough to relieve the crushing burden of oil speculation and price-fixing on American consumers and small businesses," declared Congressman Ed Markey, thus taking the prize as the first Member of Congress to exploit this natural disaster for partisan gain. His staff should tell the Massachusetts Democrat that releasing more crude won't affect prices at the pump by one penny if the oil can't be refined into gasoline.</br></br>Far more likely to reduce gas prices is yesterday's timely decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend temporarily some pollution standards on gas and diesel fuel to ease shortages. One cause of generally higher gas prices that isn't well understood by the public is the proliferation of "boutique" fuels to meet anti-pollution rules passed by Congressmen like Mr. Markey. These require special refining capacity, and with the shutdown of at least eight refineries it makes sense to ease these rules given the more urgent need to rebuild fuel supplies.</br></br>Even better, the EPA waived the rules for all 50 states, not just those directly hit by the hurricane. This recognizes that Katrina will end up affecting gas prices nationwide because of shortages and delivery delays, so 50-state relief ought to reduce the number of local price spikes. We wish the EPA had extended the waivers beyond September 15, but at least that's the day the EPA's requirements for summer-fuel blends expire and the industry may have winter fuel stocks ready to go.
Call it alphabet-and-numbers soup: The exchange-traded-fund industry is about to launch a "130/30" ETF.</br></br>The product, from ProShare Advisors LLC of Bethesda, Md., represents a move by the ETF industry into an increasingly popular category of funds that bet on share-price declines as well as gains in a bid to juice returns. These so-called 130/30 funds have been proliferating in the mutual-fund industry as small investors clamor for investment vehicles that resemble hedge funds, those largely unregulated investment pools for wealthy individuals and institutions.</br></br>Some financial pros say ETFs, which are akin to index-based mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks, may offer one of the cheapest ways for small investors to get access to generally pricey hedge-fund tactics, which aim to create positive returns with low volatility regardless of what the stock market is doing. The reason: ETFs are tax efficient and usually have lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds because they are based on indexes, not actively managed by salaried stock pickers. "The 130/30 is the fastest growing, hot new thing in the market," says Matt Hougan, editor of IndexUniverse.com, a Web site dedicated to index-based investing. "This fund, by packaging that strategy into a passive product and charging what I expect to be a relatively low expense ratio and making it available to advisers and retail investors, is pushing the ETF industry to the next level."</br></br>In simplest terms, a 130/30 fund invests $100 in stocks expected to increase in value. It borrows and sells $30 worth of shares expected to fall in price, with the aim of replacing those borrowed shares with stock bought later at a lower price. The proceeds from that so-called short sale are used to buy stocks thought to be undervalued, so the fund ends up investing $130 in stocks expected to rise in price and $30 in shares expected to fall.</br></br>The goal of ProShare Advisors' planned 130/30 ProShares ETF is to mimic the performance of a 130/30 index, before fees and expenses. The fund's prospectus doesn't name the index the fund will track, give details on expected expenses or say when the fund will be available to investors, and the company declined to elaborate. The fund will use a mathematical approach to determine the quantity and mix of positions to hold to approximate the performance of its benchmark, the prospectus says. Credit Suisse Group, meanwhile, said at a panel discussion last week that it and an ETF provider plan to launch a 130/30 ETF this spring based on an index it created. Credit Suisse declined to name the provider.
Republicans on Capitol Hill responded with hostility Tuesday to a White House proposal to allow cash-strapped states to raise unemployment-insurance taxes. But in some states struggling with rising debt and empty coffers, officials said the plan should be considered.</br></br>Administration officials say the proposal, to be included in President Barack Obama's budget plan for the next fiscal year, is intended to help states that so far have borrowed $42.4 billion from the federal government to keep benefits flowing after exhausting the reserves used to pay unemployment benefits.</br></br>Some of those 31 states have borrowed so heavily, and repaid the loans so slowly, that they triggered automatic tax increases designed to reimburse the federal government.</br></br>Already, employers in three states -- Michigan, Indiana and South Carolina -- are paying higher federal unemployment taxes because of state debts to Washington. More than half the states could be hit by the end of the year.</br></br>It is unclear whether trade groups and state GOP leaders will favor the deal and pressure congressional Republicans at least to negotiate over the plan, especially as employers in more states incur penalty taxes. An Obama administration economist said those rising taxes would feel like "a gun to the head" of employers in those states.
WASHINGTON--First Tennessee Bank, a unit of First Horizon National Corp., was the biggest borrower of short-term funds from the Federal Reserve during the fourth quarter of 2010, following a technology glitch, according to data released Friday.</br></br>Based in Memphis, Tenn., the bank borrowed $1.017 billion on Nov. 24, 2010, the largest single loan during the period and bigger than any other bank's total borrowing.</br></br>First Tennessee tapped the central bank's discount window once because of a technology glitch that halted the wire-transfer service between the bank and its regional Federal Reserve bank on the day before Thanksgiving in 2010. The technology problem disrupted the ability of the bank's bond broker-dealer to settle securities on the eve of a holiday, said the bank's corporate treasurer, Tommy Adams.</br></br>In total, the banks borrowed $3.686 billion from the discount window from October 2010 through December 2010. That included many banks that borrowed money and rolled it over several days in succession. Many loans were for a single day.</br></br>Although most of the discount-window borrowers were U.S.-based banks, some of the Fed loans were made to local branches of foreign banks. The New York unit of Spain's second largest bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, borrowed $200 million in the quarter, making it the third largest discount-window lender in the period. A spokeswoman couldn't immediately comment.
When Ahron and Bonnie Kliger's home was damaged by a 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif., the Woodland Hills couple expected their homeowners insurance to cover the cost of repairs -- about $90,000. But they wound up in a dispute with their insurance company and had to turn to an unexpected lender: the U.S. Small Business Administration.</br></br>Best known for guaranteeing small-business loans and offering advice to entrepreneurs, the SBA is sharply increasing its lending to homeowners, such as the Kligers, through its Office of Disaster Assistance. Today, the home-loan portion of the SBA's disaster-loan portfolio exceeds $3.14 billion, more than double its level three years ago. In contrast, the business loans in the portfolio total $3.45 billion, a 47% increase in three years.</br></br>SBA officials attribute the explosion in home lending to Mother Nature. Since 1993, disasters such as the Northridge earthquake, floods in the Middle West and Hurricane Andrew in Florida have created an unprecedented, concentrated demand for the low-interest loans administered by the SBA. (The interest rates are about 4% annually for business owners and individual borrowers.)</br></br>In many of the latest disasters, homeowners and renters were hit disproportionately hard, prompting huge waves of lending to individual borrowers, says Bernard Kulik, an SBA associate administrator who oversees the disaster office. After Hurricane Andrew swept through Florida in 1992, nearly 16,000 homeowners and renters there borrowed a total of $252.7 million. Businesses in the state borrowed $217.2 million. One reason for the high homeowner use: "I would say that businesses pay more attention to insurance than homeowners do," Mr. Kulik says.</br></br>Officials at the agency stress that the loan program isn't a giveaway: It estimates that 35% to 45% of all loan applicants are rejected because of credit problems, failure to provide sufficient information or other reasons. Homeowners generally can borrow no more than $200,000 to restore their homes to original condition. In addition, homeowners and renters can qualify for as much as $40,000 to replace personal property.
The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury have abandoned their short-lived policy of benign neglect and come galloping back into Latin America. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, in the region this week, is no longer talking tough love. With the recent bailout of Uruguay and a deal for Brazil in the works, he's no longer practicing it either. Will they never learn?</br></br>After more than $250 billion of assistance to debtor countries in the swinging 1990s, new management at the IMF and Treasury took a new tack. No more bailouts of badly run economies! No more money to defend exchange rates! Losses would teach the virtues of due diligence and careful risk evaluation.</br></br>This was not a punitive, small-minded assessment. The judgment was that the IMF rescue operations, assisted or even developed by Treasury, had increased risk by encouraging too much borrowing. Instead of taking in risk capital by offering equity, companies in emerging markets could hold on to their equity and leverage earnings by borrowing dollars from local banks. The local banks borrowed dollars from foreign lenders but lent in local currency. This added a currency risk to the banks' default risk. When foreign lenders became nervous about the size of the borrowing country's or banks' repayment obligations, they did not renew their loans. A run soon started against local banks, currency and government debt.</br></br>This policy reached a peak in the Clinton years, when Mexico, Russia, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina, and others received massive IMF, Treasury, and multilateral loans to bail out banks and pay off foreign lenders. Often, the foreign banks renewed their loans, on more profitable terms, after the IMF put in new money.</br></br>Wall Street worshipped at the Robert Rubin-Larry Summers shrine. The bankers collected fees for renegotiating the debt. They declared these policies successful because they were repaid, even though countries like Mexico, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia suffered deep recessions and ended with larger debts.
Some states may issue municipal bonds to shore up their underfunded unemployment-benefits programs, gaining flexibility but not necessarily a long-term answer to keeping the programs solvent.</br></br>Unemployment-insurance programs are jointly funded through federal and state employer-payroll taxes, but many states borrowed federal cash to replenish their funds as jobless claims rose during the recession. The economic-stimulus bill of 2009 temporarily waived interest payments on those federal loans.</br></br>But the waiver expired at the end of 2010, and the states that owe money--32 states and the Virgin Islands, according to analysis service Federal Funds Information for States--are weighing their options. Nevada, Idaho and South Carolina are among states looking at refinancing in the bond market before the first interest payment on the federal loans is due in September.</br></br>Some state officials are looking to refinance because they want to avoid paying interest through one of several unappealing options: charging a special assessment on businesses struggling to recover from the recession or finding the money in already-squeezed general funds.</br></br>The bonds are attractive because interest rates in the municipal-bond market are now lower than the 4.41% rate the federal government began charging in January on money borrowed for the trust funds.
It has been five years since the onset of the global financial crisis. The first cracks in financial markets appeared in August 2007. That is so long ago, it's easy to overlook just how unusual these times are.</br></br>Here's one signpost: Investors are so skittish that instead of demanding interest when they lend to governments, they are actually paying to put money into the coffers of the financially sturdiest governments. We have blown past zero interest rates. Investors lend 100 euros (or Danish kroner or Swiss francs) and get back 99 and change.</br></br>Wow.</br></br>The European Financial Stability Facility, backed by the stronger governments of Europe, this week borrowed 1.43 billion euros ($1.77 billion) for three months at a yield of minus 0.0217%. Denmark recently raised 420 million kroner ($70 million) at minus 0.59%. Even more remarkable, Germany borrowed 4.17 billion euros for two years at an average yield of minus 0.06%. Markets have pushed two-year yields on Swiss government debt below zero regularly, and Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands occasionally.</br></br>Interest rates below zero used to be more economists' fantasy than reality. Few thought central banks would ever need, let alone be able, to cut rates below zero. When the U.S. was struggling in 2009, Harvard University's Greg Mankiw observed that minus 3% rates would help. "You could borrow and spend $100 and repay $97 next year," he wrote. That would give spending a boost. The problem, he added, is "nobody would lend on those terms. . . . It would be better to stick the cash in your mattress."
State governments are borrowing heavily from the federal government to keep paying unemployment-insurance benefits and, even with the weak job market, most states are raising payroll taxes to pay off the loans.</br></br>Thirty one states, their unemployment-insurance funds empty, have borrowed nearly $41 billion from the federal government. California alone has borrowed nearly $8.8 billion as of mid-November, according to the Labor Department.</br></br>As states try to replenish the funds and begin to repay the loans, employers are facing increases in both state and federal payroll taxes, a potential barrier to new hiring.</br></br>"Employers were hit with these adjustments quite a bit last year," said Richard Hobbie, executive director for the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. A National Employment Law Project analysis found that 41 states increased unemployment-insurance payroll taxes this year by an average of nearly 33.9%. The largest was a 168.5% boost from 2009 in Hawaii.</br></br>Payroll taxes levied by states fund unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks -- and longer in some states. The federal government requires states to pay benefits even if their unemployment funds run out of cash. As in past periods of high joblessness, the federal government has paid for extended unemployment benefits, this time for as long as 99 weeks.


What a difference a month makes.</br></br>In July, consumer confidence reached a 29-year high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at an all-time high, unemployment rates plumbed 28-year lows, and the dollar grew stronger against virtually every currency on earth. By late August consumer confidence was down, as was the dollar, and a growing number of economists were forecasting recession in 1999. Yet no sooner had the doomsayers spoken then the Dow rebounded and the economic outlook brightened once again.</br></br>Volatile markets will always be with us. But what's of real concern is the increasingly volatile and self-contradictory nature of our economic policies. The Federal Reserve, shifting abruptly from the inflation front to the recession front, has cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point and revved up monetary growth rates beyond nearly all targeted growth ranges. Yet undermining this new tack are constrictive fiscal policies -- higher taxes and burgeoning regulations -- which virtually guarantee that output cannot keep pace with the money supply. If previous business cycles are any guide, the result will almost certainly be a return of inflation and the end of the steady-growth economy.</br></br>Fiscal and regulatory policies today are particularly burdensome. Taxes consume 42% of personal income, and regulations cost 10% of gross domestic product. The federal tax code has grown from 11,400 words when it was conceived in 1913 to 555 million words today. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, which like so many of its predecessors was billed as a tax-code simplifier, actually created 824 amendments and added 285 new sections to the existing code. It requires an estimated 60 million hours of extra work by taxpayers, creates 18 new tax forms and revises 230 existing forms. As Mark Twain said, "History may not repeat itself, but it sure rhymes."</br></br>What measures might be taken to synchronize fiscal and monetary policies into a pro-growth, price-stabilizing mode? Years ago, Milton Friedman recommended putting the Fed on automatic pilot, meaning that it should create money at a steady rate of 3% to 5%, consistent with the estimated long-term growth potential of real output. In revisiting this guide, it is especially helpful to recall that in its 84-year history the Fed has tended to be reactive rather than pre-emptive. Its sudden midcourse corrections have merely amplified the swings of the business cycle.
Consider "casual" drug users and what some of Maryland's top civic, political, law enforcement and business leaders want to do to them:</br></br>Some want to make them serve at least one night in jail. Some want them to pay a $1,000 fine. Some want a sentence of community service, or to take away their driver's licenses, or to publish their names in the newspaper. Prince George's County Sheriff James V. Aluisi would send first-time drug offenders to a military-style boot camp.</br></br>That's how it went as more than 500 Marylanders from the private and public sectors swapped ideas and let off steam at the University of Maryland at College Park in what was billed as the nation's first statewide drug summit. Drug use in Maryland is soaring, and so is the crime that accompanies it, state officials said. But beyond the rhetoric and goals, even the organizers of the event were frustrated by the elusiveness of permanent answers.</br></br>"You know there will be no solutions to put in a book at the end of the day," said Schaefer, who was irritated by reporters' questions on what the one-day summit would accomplish.</br></br>It was enough, said Robert R. Neall, the former House minority leader from Anne Arundel County who is now chairman of the Governor's Drug and Alcohol Abuse Commission, that Maryland leaders had "come together one day under one roof to discuss one problem." "Governor William Donald Schaefer's Statewide Drug Summit," as the event was named, was typical of the governor's penchant for public relations and group interaction. He divided the crowd into groups and told them to report back with ideas, even "way-out ideas."
Half a year after Congress enacted the largest economic stimulus plan in the nation's history, the measure is contributing to what increasingly looks like a budding recovery, analysts say, but significant concern remains about rising unemployment and the initiative's contribution to the federal budget deficit.</br></br>With the Obama administration under fire for what critics call unrestrained spending and polls showing the American public ambivalent about the impact of the stimulus plan, officials are pushing back, seeking to highlight the role played by their polices in fueling a recovery.</br></br>Vice President Biden, making what the White House billed as a major speech Thursday, touted the role of the $787 billion stimulus program in lifting the economy.</br></br>"The Recovery Act has played a significant role in changing the trajectory of our economy and changing the conversation about the economy in this country," Biden said in a speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "Instead of talking about the beginning of a depression, we are talking about the end of a recession."</br></br>While some congressional Republicans and others are dubious about the success of the stimulus plan, economists generally agree that the package has played a significant part in stabilizing the economy. They are less certain about the size of the impact.
The amount of money Americans gave to charities in 1991 plunged to its lowest level in at least five years, as the recession squeezed household budgets and confidence in the United Way and other nonprofits sagged, according to a new national survey.</br></br>Billed as the most comprehensive look at charitable-giving patterns to date, the survey for a Washington-based group of charitable organizations said the typical U.S. household gave $649 to charities, churches and other nonprofit groups last year, down from the average $806 donation in 1990.</br></br>The 1991 figure, which was adjusted for inflation, marked the smallest average giving amount since the Gallup polling organization began surveying households for the Independent Sector, an umbrella group serving nonprofit groups nationwide.</br></br>The latest poll of 2,600 people, which surveyed giving on the basis of age, race and income, seemed to confirm what many charities in the Washington area and elsewhere already have experienced: Meager increases or declines in giving, as the lean economy has pushed demand for food, shelter and other services to record levels.</br></br>This year, the picture has grown even more bleak because thousands of charities receive most of their funds through the auspices of United Way, whose national organization was rocked by scandal.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker yesterday predicted that a major international banking agreement among the leading industrial countries would be signed by the end of the year.</br></br>‰ÛÏI think it will be done,‰Û said Volcker in his farewell appearance before the House Banking Committee. Tm sorry I won't be here to see it.‰Û</br></br>Such an agreement ‰ÛÏwould be a big step forward‰Û toward reducing competitive pressure between banking systems, Volcker said. Foreign banks now often have lower capital requirements than U.S. banks, enabling them to offer better rates to borrowers.</br></br>Appearing relaxed and jovial, Volcker listened to a slew of tributes from the unusually large number of members of the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance who showed up for what was billed as a hearing on globalization of financial markets.</br></br>D.C. Del. Walter Fauntroy declared, ‰ÛÏWhen the history of the fourth quarter of the 20th century is written, your name will be [remembered as] one who made the most important contribution to the economic recovery of this nation and the economic stability of the world.‰Û And committee chairman Fernand St Germain (D-R.I.) closed the session with an emotional ‰ÛÏthank you‰Û to Volcker.
Harmony and good-feeling predominated yesterday as a tractorcade billed as the last that will burden Washington‰Ûªs streets took the American Agriculture Movement‰Ûªs protest to the Federal Reserve Building.</br></br>School children and government workers waved and some even cheered in contrast to last Friday‰Ûªs traflic-snarling tractor parade to the White House that enraged many home-bound commuters and resulted in the arrest of four farmers.</br></br>Yesterday‰Ûªs demonstration had 119 tractors‰ÛÓabout half the number used last Friday. It began at 10 a.m. and ended about 1 p.m., making relatively little impact on midday traffic.</br></br>After it was over. Police Chief Bur-tell M. Jefferson, smiling, nodded approvingly in the farmers‰Ûª direction and said, ‰ÛÏThey did a good job.‰Û</br></br>As the tractors were ringing the Federal Reserve Building at 20th Street and Constitution Avenue to protest high interest rates, a large part of the Mall was reclaimed for public use. Police dismantled much of the barricade of buses and tracks that has impounded the tractors on the Mall since Feb. 5. The barricade remained in place only east of Seventh Street.
President Clinton, in a wide-ranging defense of his economic policy, urged the nation today to continue shrinking the federal debt and seeking new trade opportunities to keep the economy strong.</br></br>In what the White House billed as a "major economic speech," the president rejected criticisms of his fiscal strategy--which has largely focused on deficit reduction--from the political left and right. Noting that some liberals want him to spend more heavily on social issues and some conservatives want deeper tax cuts, Clinton said, "You can't forget what got you here."</br></br>Clinton said the government also must continue to encourage the growth of information technologies and to close the "digital divide" that keeps many from sharing the benefits of computerization and the Internet. And he renewed his call for China's membership in the World Trade Organization, which some labor and environmental groups oppose.</br></br>The federal debt reduction that has occurred under his watch "set in motion a virtuous cycle" that lowered interest rates and made it easier for businesses to expand and for families to pay off loans for cars, houses and college educations, Clinton told an audience at the University of Pennsylvania. His 44-minute address was the first in an annual lecture series founded by entrepreneur and Clinton political supporter Michael Granoff.</br></br>The president said he will convene "a major White House conference" on the economy on April 5. It will include several economists, corporate executives and others to "focus on the most cutting-edge issues facing the new economy," an administration briefing paper said.
A group of distinguished private citizens, most of them from business, have proposed strengthening the President‰Ûªs hand to fight slumps and inflation.</br></br>The recommendation for increased executive power and responsibility is the central theme of the long-awaited report from the Commission on Money and Credit.</br></br>In what has been billed as the most comprehensive survey of the Nation's monetary system in 50 years, the report breaks little new ground. Most of its proposals comprise the conventional wisdom of the</br></br>What is significant is I lie remarkable degree of agreement on the part of notable business and financial leaders that tile economy cannot he left exclusively to private decision-making and further, that the Federal Government must exercise greater sway over the economy‰Ûªs course.</br></br>Chairman of the Commission, which spent three years to produce the 300-page report, was Krn/.ar B.

Maryland insurance regulators yesterday cracked down on insurance agents who are illegally charging clients for filing insurance verification forms required by the state.</br></br>Maryland drivers who paid insurance companies to file the FR-19 auto insurance verification form are entitled to be reimbursed within 30 days, and the firms that illegally imposed the fee will be fined as much as $50,000, officials of the state insurance commission said.</br></br>Insurance Commissioner Edward J. Muhl issued an order directing the state‰Ûªs 500 licensed property and casualty insurance companies to submit to the commission a list of policyholders who were improperly charged, the agents who billed the policyholders and a written explanation of the firm‰Ûªs procedure for filing forms on behalf of policyholders.</br></br>"Any such charge that has been made [for filing the FR-19] constitutes a violation of the Maryland insurance law,‰Û Muhl‰Ûªs order said. Not only do guilty insurance firms that charged the fee face fines, but also agents who imposed the fee can be fined $500 per violation, he said. More than 35,000 insurance agents work in Maryland, according to the insurance commission.</br></br>Muhl initiated yesterday‰Ûªs action after receiving complaints from state Del. Casper R. Taylor Jr. (D-Allegany and Washington counties), who said he had received numerous complaints.
Investors were quick to scoop up the latest new issue of global depositary shares from Samsung Electronics Co. No wonder: The South Korean chip maker is being billed as the cheapest semiconductor stock in the world.</br></br>Even those fund managers who prefer to be underweighted in South Korea right now admit they're fans of Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest producer of memory chips.</br></br>"Bottom up, we like Samsung Electronics," says Eric Sandlund, managing director of Prudential Portfolio Managers in Hong Kong. He says Prudential subscribed to the recent GDS offering even though he's keeping an underweighted position in the South Korean stock market overall.</br></br>"We like the company and it's trading at under six times [prospective 1995] earnings. Even if you take the view that the [semiconductor] industry is near the top of the cycle . . . it looks cheap," Mr. Sandlund says.</br></br>Indeed Samsung Electronics' low price/earnings ratio has analysts and investors swarming over the stock. "Why pay [13 to 14] times prospective earnings for a U.S. semiconductor stock when you can buy a similar company on the other side of the world, with potentially better earnings predictability and superior economies of scale, at only one-third of the price?" asks Namuh Rhee, vice president at J.P. Morgan Securities in Hong Kong, in a recent report on the company.
